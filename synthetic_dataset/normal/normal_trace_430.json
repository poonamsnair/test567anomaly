  "user_question": "What would happen to global weather patterns if the Himalayas were suddenly flattened?",
  "final_answer": "If the Himalayas were suddenly flattened, it would drastically alter global weather patterns. The Himalayas act as a barrier that influences monsoon patterns and blocks cold winds from Central Asia, affecting the climate of the Indian subcontinent. Flattening them would likely lead to significant changes in monsoon intensity and distribution, potentially causing shifts in precipitation patterns across Asia and beyond.",

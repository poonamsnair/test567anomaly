  "user_question": "How would the weather patterns change if Earth rotated twice as fast?",
  "final_answer": "If Earth rotated twice as fast, the Coriolis effect would be stronger, leading to more pronounced and possibly more frequent cyclones and anticyclones. Weather systems would move faster, and day-night cycles would be shorter, affecting temperature variations and potentially leading to more extreme weather conditions.",

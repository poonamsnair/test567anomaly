  "user_question": "How can I create a self-sustaining terrarium that mimics a rainforest ecosystem?",
  "final_answer": "To create a self-sustaining terrarium that mimics a rainforest ecosystem, you need a glass container, a layer of small stones for drainage, activated charcoal to keep the environment fresh, a layer of potting soil, and a selection of small tropical plants like ferns and mosses. Ensure the terrarium is sealed to maintain humidity and place it in indirect sunlight.",

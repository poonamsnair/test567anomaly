  "final_answer": "Tardigrades survive extreme conditions through cryptobiosis, a state where their metabolic processes shut down. Image of a tardigrade in space generated. Cryptobiosis is a physiological state in which an organism's metabolic activities come to a reversible standstill, allowing it to survive extreme environmental conditions.",

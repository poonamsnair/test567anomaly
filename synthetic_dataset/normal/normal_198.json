  "user_question": "How can I use machine learning to predict the migration patterns of monarch butterflies?",
  "final_answer": "To predict the migration patterns of monarch butterflies using machine learning, you can collect data on environmental factors such as temperature, wind patterns, and historical migration routes. Then, use a supervised learning algorithm like Random Forest or Neural Networks to train a model that predicts migration patterns based on these features.",

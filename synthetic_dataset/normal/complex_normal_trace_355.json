It involves a hypothetical cat that is simultaneously alive and dead, depending on an earlier random event. Quantum superposition is the principle that a quantum system can exist in multiple states at once until it is measured. Schr\u00f6dinger's cat illustrates this by being in a superposition of alive and dead states until observed. Image illustrating Schr\u00f6dinger's cat generated.",

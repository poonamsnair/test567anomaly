  "user_question": "What would be the impact on global academic research if teleportation of physical objects became possible?",
  "final_answer": "If teleportation of physical objects became possible, global academic research would experience a significant transformation. Collaboration would become more seamless as researchers could instantly share physical samples and equipment. This could accelerate scientific discoveries and reduce logistical barriers. However, it could also raise ethical and security concerns regarding the transport of sensitive materials.",

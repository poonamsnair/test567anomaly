  "final_answer": "If a basketball court was built on the moon, the game would be significantly different due to the moon's lower gravity. Players could jump much higher and longer, and the ball would travel further and slower. The court would need to be enclosed to provide an atmosphere and protect players from the harsh lunar environment.",

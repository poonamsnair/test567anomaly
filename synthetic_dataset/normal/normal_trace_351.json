  "user_question": "What would be the impact on global stock markets if a new metal, stronger and lighter than titanium, was discovered?",
  "final_answer": "The discovery of a new metal stronger and lighter than titanium could lead to significant shifts in global stock markets. Companies in industries such as aerospace, automotive, and construction might see increased stock prices due to potential cost savings and performance improvements. Conversely, companies heavily invested in titanium production might experience a decline in stock value. Overall, the impact would depend on the metal's availability, cost of production, and adoption rate across industries.",

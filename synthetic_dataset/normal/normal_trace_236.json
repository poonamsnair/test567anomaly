  "user_question": "What would happen to ocean currents if the Earth's rotation suddenly stopped?",
  "final_answer": "If the Earth's rotation suddenly stopped, ocean currents would be drastically altered. The Coriolis effect, which is caused by Earth's rotation, would cease, leading to significant changes in current patterns. Ocean currents would likely slow down and potentially change direction, causing major disruptions in climate and marine ecosystems.",

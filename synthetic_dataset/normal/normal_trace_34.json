  "user_question": "What would happen to the ecosystem if bees went extinct?",
  "final_answer": "If bees went extinct, it would lead to a significant decline in pollination, affecting plant reproduction and leading to a decrease in food crops and biodiversity. This could cause a ripple effect through the ecosystem, impacting food chains and leading to the decline of species that rely on plants for food.",

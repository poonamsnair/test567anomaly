It does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible and detectable only via its gravitational effects. Image of a hypothetical dark matter particle generated. Dark matter is detected through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the rotation of galaxies and gravitational lensing of background objects.",

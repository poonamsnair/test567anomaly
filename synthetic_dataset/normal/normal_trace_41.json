  "user_question": "What would happen to a rainforest ecosystem if all the ants disappeared?",
  "final_answer": "If all the ants disappeared from a rainforest ecosystem, it would lead to significant disruptions. Ants play crucial roles in decomposition, soil aeration, seed dispersal, and as a food source for many species. Their absence would affect plant growth, nutrient cycling, and the food web, potentially leading to a decline in biodiversity.",

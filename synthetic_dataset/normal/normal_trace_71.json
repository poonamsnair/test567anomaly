  "final_answer": "If World War I had never happened, the geopolitical landscape of Europe and the world might be vastly different. The Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires might have persisted longer, potentially delaying or altering the rise of nationalism in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. The Russian Revolution might not have occurred, possibly preventing the formation of the Soviet Union. The Treaty of Versailles, which set the stage for World War II, would not have been signed, potentially preventing the rise of Nazi Germany. Technological and social changes accelerated by the war, such as advancements in medicine and shifts in gender roles, might have developed more slowly.",

  "final_answer": "If all the ice in Antarctica melted, it would contribute to a significant rise in global sea levels, potentially by about 58 meters (190 feet), which would drastically alter global coastlines and climate patterns. The immediate impact on global temperatures would be complex, involving changes in ocean currents and albedo effects.",

  "final_answer": "If a cricket match were played on the Moon, the reduced gravity would allow the ball to travel much farther, and players could jump higher and run faster. The lack of atmosphere would mean no air resistance, affecting swing and spin. Players would need spacesuits, and the pitch would need to be specially designed to accommodate the lunar surface.",

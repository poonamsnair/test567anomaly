  "user_question": "If the Earth were a perfect cube, how would the distribution of climates change?",
  "final_answer": "If the Earth were a perfect cube, the distribution of climates would be drastically different. The corners of the cube would likely be colder due to their higher altitude and distance from the center of mass, while the center of each face might experience more extreme weather patterns due to the flat, expansive surfaces. The overall climate zones would be more fragmented and less predictable.",

  "user_question": "What would happen if all satellites suddenly stopped working?",
  "final_answer": "If all satellites suddenly stopped working, there would be widespread disruption in communication, navigation, weather forecasting, and many other services that rely on satellite technology. GPS systems would fail, affecting transportation and logistics. Weather predictions would become less accurate, and global communications would be severely impacted.",

  "user_question": "What would happen if all satellites suddenly stopped working for a day?",
  "final_answer": "If all satellites stopped working for a day, there would be significant disruptions in communication, navigation, weather forecasting, and financial transactions. GPS services would be unavailable, affecting transportation and logistics. Satellite TV and internet services would be interrupted. Weather predictions would be less accurate, and financial markets could experience delays due to disrupted data transmission.",

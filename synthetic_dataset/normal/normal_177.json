  "user_question": "What are the potential impacts of a sudden influx of bioluminescent algae on the stock market?",
  "final_answer": "A sudden influx of bioluminescent algae could impact the stock market by affecting industries such as tourism, fishing, and biotechnology. Tourism might see a boost due to increased interest in natural phenomena, while fishing could suffer due to potential disruptions in marine ecosystems. Biotechnology companies might benefit from increased research and development opportunities.",

  "final_answer": "A curveball in baseball is thrown with a grip and wrist action that imparts topspin, causing the ball to dive as it approaches the plate due to the Magnus effect. The Magnus effect occurs when the topspin creates a pressure differential, with lower pressure on top and higher pressure on the bottom, causing the ball to drop.

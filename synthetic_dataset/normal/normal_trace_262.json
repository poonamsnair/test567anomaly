  "user_question": "What would happen if tennis balls were made of metal instead of rubber?",
  "final_answer": "If tennis balls were made of metal, they would be significantly heavier, which would affect the speed and dynamics of the game. Players would find it challenging to hit the ball with the same force and accuracy, and the risk of injury would increase. The courts and rackets would also need to be modified to accommodate the increased weight and impact.",

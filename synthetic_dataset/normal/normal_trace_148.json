  "user_question": "What would happen to the ecosystem if bees went extinct?",
  "final_answer": "If bees went extinct, it would lead to a significant decline in pollination, affecting plant reproduction and leading to a decrease in food supply for many species, including humans. This could cause a collapse in ecosystems that rely on flowering plants, leading to a loss of biodiversity.",

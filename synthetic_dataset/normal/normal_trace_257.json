  "final_answer": "A rugby match on Mars would involve players wearing specialized suits to handle the lower gravity and atmospheric conditions. The game would be slower due to the reduced gravity, and the ball would travel further with each kick or throw. The field would need to be enclosed to maintain a breathable atmosphere.",

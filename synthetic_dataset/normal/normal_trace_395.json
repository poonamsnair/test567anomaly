  "user_question": "What would be the environmental impact if all the world's deserts were suddenly covered with solar panels?",
  "final_answer": "Covering all the world's deserts with solar panels would significantly increase global renewable energy production, potentially providing more energy than the world currently consumes. However, it would also have environmental impacts such as disrupting desert ecosystems, affecting local climates, and requiring massive infrastructure for energy distribution.",

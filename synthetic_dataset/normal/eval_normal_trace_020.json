  "user_question": "What would happen to ocean currents if the Earth stopped rotating?",
  "final_answer": "If the Earth stopped rotating, ocean currents would be drastically altered. The Coriolis effect, which is responsible for the deflection of currents, would cease to exist. This would lead to a significant reorganization of ocean currents, potentially causing drastic climate changes and affecting marine life.",

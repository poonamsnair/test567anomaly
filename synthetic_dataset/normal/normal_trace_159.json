  "user_question": "What would happen if the Earth suddenly stopped rotating?",
  "final_answer": "If the Earth suddenly stopped rotating, the atmosphere would continue to move at the Earth's original rotational speed, causing massive winds and destruction. The sudden stop would also cause massive earthquakes and tsunamis. Over time, the day-night cycle would change drastically, with one side of the Earth experiencing constant daylight and the other constant night.",

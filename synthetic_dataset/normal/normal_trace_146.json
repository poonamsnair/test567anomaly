  "user_question": "What would happen to the global economy if Bitcoin's value suddenly dropped to zero?",
  "final_answer": "If Bitcoin's value suddenly dropped to zero, it could lead to significant financial losses for investors and companies involved in cryptocurrency. It might cause a loss of confidence in digital currencies, lead to increased regulation, and impact related markets such as blockchain technology. However, the overall impact on the global economy would depend on the extent of Bitcoin's integration into financial systems and the exposure of major financial institutions.",

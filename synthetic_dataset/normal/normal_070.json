  "user_question": "How can I build a telescope that can see the rings of Saturn from my backyard?",
  "final_answer": "To build a telescope capable of seeing the rings of Saturn, you need a telescope with at least a 70mm aperture and a magnification of 30x to 50x. You can construct a simple refractor telescope using a convex lens with a focal length of around 700mm for the objective and a smaller lens for the eyepiece, assembled in a tube with adjustable focus.",

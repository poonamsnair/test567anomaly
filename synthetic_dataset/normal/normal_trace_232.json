  "user_question": "What would happen to the stock market if a new element was discovered that could revolutionize battery technology?",
  "final_answer": "If a new element was discovered that could revolutionize battery technology, it would likely cause significant volatility in the stock market. Companies involved in battery production, electric vehicles, and renewable energy could see their stock prices rise sharply due to anticipated future profits. Conversely, companies heavily invested in traditional energy sources might experience a decline. Market analysts would closely monitor the situation, and there could be a surge in speculative trading.",

  "user_question": "If humans could sleep only once a week, how would that affect our daily lives and productivity?",
  "final_answer": "If humans could sleep only once a week, it would likely lead to significant changes in daily routines, work schedules, and social interactions. Productivity might initially increase due to more available waking hours, but the quality of work could suffer due to potential cognitive fatigue. Social activities might become more concentrated around the sleep day, and industries related to sleep, such as mattress and sleep aid companies, might undergo drastic changes.",

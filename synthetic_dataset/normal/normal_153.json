  "user_question": "What is the scientific explanation behind why sunsets are considered beautiful?",
  "final_answer": "Sunsets are considered beautiful due to the scattering of light by the atmosphere, which creates vibrant colors. This scattering is more pronounced during sunset because the sun's light passes through more of the Earth's atmosphere, enhancing reds and oranges. Additionally, psychological and cultural factors contribute to the perception of beauty.",

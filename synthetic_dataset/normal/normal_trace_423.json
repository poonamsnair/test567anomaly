  "user_question": "What would happen to global ocean currents if the Earth's rotation slowed down significantly?",
  "final_answer": "If the Earth's rotation slowed down significantly, global ocean currents would be drastically altered. The Coriolis effect, which is responsible for the deflection of ocean currents, would weaken, leading to changes in the direction and strength of major currents. This could disrupt climate patterns, marine ecosystems, and weather systems worldwide.",

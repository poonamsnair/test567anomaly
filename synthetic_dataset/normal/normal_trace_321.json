  "user_question": "What would be the environmental impact if blockchain technology was used to track and reduce carbon emissions globally?",
  "final_answer": "Using blockchain technology to track and reduce carbon emissions globally could enhance transparency, improve data accuracy, and incentivize emission reductions through tokenized carbon credits. However, the environmental impact of blockchain itself, particularly energy-intensive proof-of-work systems, must be considered.",

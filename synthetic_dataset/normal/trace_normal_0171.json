  "user_question": "Can you summarize the latest research on black holes and create an image depicting a black hole in a galaxy?",
  "final_answer": "The latest research on black holes includes studies on their formation, the role of dark matter, and simulations of black hole mergers. Black holes are detected through gravitational effects, observing stars orbiting invisible objects, and X-ray emissions. An image of a black hole in a galaxy has been generated.",

  "user_question": "If coffee beans were discovered on Mars, how would that impact the global coffee market?",
  "final_answer": "If coffee beans were discovered on Mars, it would likely cause a significant stir in the global coffee market. Initially, there would be a surge in interest and speculation, potentially driving up prices due to the novelty and rarity. However, practical challenges such as the cost of transporting coffee from Mars and the time required for such operations would likely limit immediate market impacts. Over time, if Martian coffee became accessible, it could create a niche market segment, similar to rare and exotic coffee varieties on Earth.",

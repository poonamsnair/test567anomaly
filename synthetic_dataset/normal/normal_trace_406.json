  "final_answer": "To design a robot for autonomously sorting and recycling waste, it would need a combination of sensors like cameras and spectrometers for material identification, a robotic arm for sorting, and AI algorithms for decision-making. The robot would be equipped with a conveyor belt system to transport waste and a database to classify materials based on recycling guidelines.",

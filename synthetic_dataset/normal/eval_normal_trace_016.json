  "user_question": "What would happen if a spacecraft traveled through a black hole?",
  "final_answer": "If a spacecraft traveled through a black hole, it would likely be destroyed by extreme gravitational forces. Theoretical physics suggests that the spacecraft would be stretched and compressed in a process known as spaghettification. The exact outcome is unknown due to the singularity at the black hole's center, where current physics cannot accurately describe conditions.",

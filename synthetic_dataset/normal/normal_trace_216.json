  "user_question": "What would be the impact on global markets if a new metal, stronger than titanium and lighter than aluminum, was discovered?",
  "final_answer": "The discovery of a new metal stronger than titanium and lighter than aluminum would likely cause significant shifts in global markets. Industries such as aerospace, automotive, and construction could see reduced costs and increased efficiency, leading to stock price increases for companies in these sectors. Conversely, companies heavily invested in titanium and aluminum might face declines. Commodity markets would adjust to the new supply and demand dynamics.",

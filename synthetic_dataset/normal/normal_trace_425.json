  "user_question": "What would happen to a rainforest ecosystem if all the ants disappeared?",
  "final_answer": "If all the ants disappeared from a rainforest ecosystem, it would lead to significant disruptions. Ants play crucial roles in soil aeration, seed dispersal, and as a food source for many animals. Their absence could lead to soil compaction, reduced plant diversity, and a decline in species that rely on ants for food, ultimately affecting the entire food web.",

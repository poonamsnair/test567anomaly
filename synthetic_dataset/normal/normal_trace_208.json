  "user_question": "What would happen if a rugby match was played on the surface of Mars?",
  "final_answer": "Playing rugby on Mars would be extremely challenging due to the lower gravity, which is about 38% of Earth's, affecting the players' movements and the ball's trajectory. Additionally, the thin atmosphere and extreme temperatures would require players to wear specialized suits, making the game impractical.",

  "final_answer": "Deep-sea plants, such as certain types of algae, perform photosynthesis using bioluminescence or chemosynthesis due to the lack of sunlight. Image of a deep-sea plant performing photosynthesis generated. Chemosynthesis uses chemical energy from inorganic molecules, while regular photosynthesis uses sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.",

  "user_question": "What would be the impact on cricket if the game was played with a cube-shaped ball?",
  "final_answer": "Playing cricket with a cube-shaped ball would drastically alter the dynamics of the game. The unpredictable bounce and roll of the cube would make batting and fielding much more challenging. Bowlers would have to adapt their techniques significantly, and the overall pace and strategy of the game would change. It would likely lead to more defensive play and lower scoring games.",

  "user_question": "How has the company's tax situation evolved in terms of current vs. deferred tax components over the past three years (fiscal 2023-2025)?",
  "final_answer": "The company's tax profile has shifted significantly over the three-year period. The ratio of current tax provision to total income tax expense has increased from 0.926 in fiscal 2023 to 1.031 in fiscal 2024 and further to 1.107 in fiscal 2025. This indicates a growing proportion of current tax obligations relative to deferred tax benefits, suggesting either improved profitability requiring immediate tax payments or changes in timing differences between book and tax accounting. The trend toward ratios above 1.0 in recent years indicates the company is paying more in current taxes than its total tax expense, likely due to deferred tax benefits.",

By fiscal 2024, the current tax provision grew to $5,749 million, while the company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $171 million, resulting in a slightly lower total tax provision of $5,578 million. This trend continued into fiscal 2025, with the current tax provision rising further to $6,815 million and the deferred tax benefit increasing to $663 million, leading to a total tax provision of $6,152 million. This indicates a consistent growth in taxes paid on current income, while changes in temporary differences between book and tax income have resulted in a growing tax benefit from deferred taxes.",

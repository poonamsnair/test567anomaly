  "user_question": "What is the company's effective tax rate structure and geographic income distribution for fiscal year 2023, and how does it compare to the U.S. statutory rate?",
  "final_answer": "For fiscal year 2023, the company had a complex tax structure with significant international operations. The ratio of combined U.S. state income taxes and income taxed outside the U.S. to the U.S. statutory tax rate was 0.200, indicating that non-federal tax components represented 20% of the statutory rate. Additionally, U.S. domestic income represented 88.7% of total income before taxes, showing that while the majority of income is generated domestically, the company has meaningful international operations that affect its overall tax strategy.",

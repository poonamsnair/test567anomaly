  "user_question": "How has the company's stock-based compensation expense evolved over the past three years (2022-2024), and what does this trend suggest about the company's equity compensation strategy?",
  "final_answer": "The company's net stock-based compensation expense has shown consistent growth over the three-year period, increasing from $6,209 million in 2022 to $7,960 million in 2023 (28.2% increase) and further to $8,908 million in 2024 (11.9% increase). This upward trend suggests the company is expanding its equity compensation programs, likely to attract and retain talent in a competitive market. The growth rate has moderated from 2023 to 2024, which could indicate the company is reaching a more sustainable level of equity compensation or adjusting its strategy in response to market conditions.",

While expense continued to climb in 2024, the growth rate slowed from 28 % to about 12 %, indicating Microsoft is still leaning heavily on equity awards to attract and retain talent—especially for cloud- and AI-focused roles—but is beginning to moderate the pace at which it expands those grants. The trend suggests an equity-heavy compensation strategy remains central, yet management appears to be balancing dilution and cost concerns by tapering the growth of new awards after a surge in 2023.",

However, the final answer mentions the expenses as $6,209 million for 2022, $7,960 million for 2023, and $8,908 million for 2024, which are different figures. This discrepancy suggests an agent mistake in processing or reporting the data.",

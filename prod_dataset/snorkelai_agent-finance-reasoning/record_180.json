  "user_question": "How has the company's financing structure for leases evolved between 2022 and 2024, and what does this suggest about their capital allocation strategy?",
  "final_answer": "The company's lease financing structure has undergone a significant shift between 2022 and 2024. The ratio of finance lease principal payments to interest payments increased dramatically from 53.125 in 2022 to 85.609 in 2024. This substantial increase indicates that the company is either taking on finance leases with more favorable terms (lower interest rates) or is prioritizing aggressive principal repayment. Additionally, finance leases represent only 3.4% of total undiscounted lease cash flows, suggesting the company primarily relies on operating leases. This evolution suggests a more disciplined capital allocation approach, potentially reducing long-term financing costs and improving balance sheet efficiency.",

For finance leases, the weighted average remaining lease term has slightly decreased from 14.0 years to 13.7 years, while the weighted average discount rate has increased from 3.4% to 3.6%. Similarly, for operating leases, the weighted average remaining lease term has seen a marginal decrease from 11.6 years to 11.5 years, and the weighted average discount rate has risen from 3.7% to 3.9%. This suggests a trend towards shorter lease commitments and a higher cost of lease financing. This could imply a capital allocation strategy that prioritizes flexibility and is responsive to the rising interest rate environment. However, to provide a comprehensive answer about the evolution from 2022 and a more detailed analysis of the capital allocation strategy, further information regarding lease liability maturities and cash flows is required.",

  "user_question": "What is the composition and diversification of the company's pension plan assets, and how does this impact investment risk management as of December 31, 2023-2024?",
  "final_answer": "The company's pension plan assets show a well-diversified investment strategy with strong liquidity. As of December 31, 2023, Level 1 assets (most liquid, traded securities) comprise 73.2% of total plan assets, indicating low liquidity risk and transparent pricing. By December 31, 2024, investments carried at net asset value represent 10.7% of total plan assets, suggesting exposure to alternative investments like private equity or hedge funds. This asset allocation balances liquidity needs with potential for higher returns through alternative investments, while maintaining a conservative approach with the majority in liquid securities. The plan assets also grew at a healthy 6.0% rate during 2024, demonstrating positive investment performance.",

The asset allocation in 2024 was composed of 68.8% in equity securities ($9.8 billion), 12.3% in fixed maturity securities ($1.7 billion), 14.6% in investment funds and other ($2.1 billion), and 4.2% in cash and cash equivalents ($0.6 billion). In comparison, 2023's allocation consisted of 63.4% in equity securities ($8.5 billion), 16.0% in fixed maturity securities ($2.1 billion), 17.2% in investment funds and other ($2.3 billion), and 3.4% in cash and cash equivalents ($0.4 billion). The portfolio's heavy concentration in equity securities indicates a growth-oriented investment strategy, which, while offering the potential for high returns, also exposes the plan to significant market risk. Diversification across fixed-income and other investments helps to mitigate this risk, though the increased allocation to equities in 2024 suggests a slightly more aggressive risk posture compared to the previous year.",

  "user_question": "What is the company's lease financing structure and how are lease costs distributed between interest and amortization components for the year ended June 30, 2022?",
  "final_answer": "The company's lease financing structure shows that interest expenses represent 30.4% of total finance lease costs, while amortization of right-of-use assets accounts for 69.6% of total finance lease costs for the year ended June 30, 2022. This indicates that the majority of lease costs are driven by asset depreciation rather than financing costs, suggesting either relatively low interest rates on the leases or that the leases have significant upfront asset values relative to their financing components.",

The amortization component, which represents the depreciation of the leased asset over its useful life, amounted to $980 million for the year. The interest component, which is the cost of borrowing associated with the lease, was $429 million. These two figures, when combined, make up the total finance lease cost for the period, reflecting how the company accounts for its leased assets and the associated financing expenses.",

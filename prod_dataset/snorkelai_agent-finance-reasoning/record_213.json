This table contains the components of income tax expense for the years 2022, 2023, and 2024. I will query this table to get all the data for 2022.\n\nThen, I will move on to the second question. To assess how effectively management is utilizing assets to generate profits, I will calculate the Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE). For this, I will need to query the income statement and balance sheet. I will first identify the relevant tables and then query them to get the necessary data, such as net income, total assets, and total equity. Finally, I will use the calculator to compute the ratios and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nFirst, let's get the tax position trend for 2022.",

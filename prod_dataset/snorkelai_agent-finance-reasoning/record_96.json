  "user_question": "What is the company's effective tax rate burden compared to the statutory rate, and what does this indicate about the company's tax efficiency for 2024?",
  "final_answer": "The company's effective tax rate is 6 percentage points lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate in 2024. This indicates strong tax efficiency, likely driven by tax optimization strategies, foreign tax rate differentials, or tax credits. The lower effective rate suggests the company is effectively managing its tax burden and maximizing after-tax profitability.",

The effective tax rate is higher than the statutory rate, which suggests that the company's tax burden is increased by factors such as state and local income taxes, taxes on foreign earnings, and other miscellaneous tax items. A higher effective tax rate compared to the statutory rate indicates lower tax efficiency for the company, as it is paying a larger percentage of its income in taxes than the standard federal rate.",

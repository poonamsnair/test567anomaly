  "user_question": "How is the company's tax planning efficiency evolving over time, and what significant one-time adjustments affected the tax rate in fiscal 2023?",
  "final_answer": "The company's tax planning efficiency has been declining over the three-year period from fiscal 2023 to 2025. The ratio of current tax provision to total income tax expense increased from 0.926 in fiscal 2023 to 1.031 in fiscal 2024 and further to 1.107 in fiscal 2025. This trend suggests the company is paying a higher proportion of its tax obligation in cash rather than deferring it, which could indicate less effective tax planning or changes in business operations that reduce deferred tax benefits. Additionally, in fiscal 2023, there was a significant one-time adjustment related to \"separation, disposal and wind-down of certain business operations\" that contributed 50% to the effective tax rate differential, indicating substantial tax implications from restructuring activities.",

First, I will identify the most relevant tables for this task. I will be looking for tables related to income tax, effective tax rate reconciliation, and deferred taxes. The most promising tables from the `get_descriptions` output are:\n    *   `us_gaap_ScheduleOfEffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationTableTextBlock`: This table will most likely contain the reconciliation of the federal statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate, which will highlight any significant adjustments.\n    *   `us_gaap_ScheduleOfComponentsOfIncomeTaxExpenseBenefitTableTextBlock`: This table will give me a breakdown of the income tax expense.\n    *   `us_gaap_ScheduleOfDeferredTaxAssetsAndLiabilitiesTableTextBlock`: This can provide details on deferred taxes, which are a key part of tax planning.\n    *   `us_gaap_ScheduleOfIncomeBeforeIncomeTaxDomesticAndForeignTableTextBlock`: This will give me the income before tax, which is needed to calculate the effective tax rate.\n    *   `us_gaap_ScheduleOfUnrecognizedTaxBenefitsRollForwardTableTextBlock`: This table can provide information about uncertain tax positions.\n\n2.  Next, I will use the `get_table_info` tool to examine the tables and understand their structure and content.\n\n3.  Then, I will use the `sql_query` tool to extract the necessary data from the tables. I will focus on getting the effective tax rates for the past few years, and the details of the tax rate reconciliation for fiscal 2023.\n\n4.  Finally, I will synthesize the information from the queries to describe the evolution of Walmart's tax planning efficiency and identify any significant one-time adjustments in fiscal 2023.\n\nI will start by examining `us_gaap_ScheduleOfEffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationTableTextBlock`.",

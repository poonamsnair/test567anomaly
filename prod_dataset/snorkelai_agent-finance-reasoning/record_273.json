  "user_question": "What is the company's investment portfolio composition and how concentrated are the holdings in 2023-2024?",
  "final_answer": "The company's investment portfolio shows a moderate concentration in available-for-sale debt investments, which represented 11.58% of total investments in 2023. In contrast, restricted cash and cash equivalents represent a minimal portion at only 0.002% of total investments in 2024. This suggests the company maintains a diversified investment strategy with significant allocation to debt securities while keeping minimal restricted cash positions.",

Equity method investments represented about 22.42%, while available-for-sale debt investments constituted around 11.58%. The remaining portion of the portfolio consisted of equity and other investments at about 1.60% and restricted cash and cash equivalents at approximately 0.51%.\n\nBy 2024, the total investment portfolio had significantly increased to $13,480 million. The concentration in time deposits became even more pronounced, making up about 88.72% of the total investments. In contrast, the proportion of other investment types decreased. Equity method investments accounted for approximately 7.03%, available-for-sale debt investments for about 3.84%, equity and other investments for roughly 0.25%, and restricted cash and cash equivalents for a mere 0.16% of the total portfolio. This shift indicates a substantial increase in the company's holdings of time deposits, leading to a more concentrated investment portfolio in 2024 compared to the previous year.",

  "user_question": "How does the company's operating lease liability valuation compare to its total undiscounted future lease commitments, and what does this suggest about the present value discount applied?",
  "final_answer": "The company's total reported operating lease liability represents 75.3% of its total undiscounted future operating lease payments, indicating a present value discount of approximately 24.7%. This suggests the company has significant long-term lease commitments with a substantial time value of money impact, which is typical for companies with multi-year lease agreements. The discount reflects the weighted average cost of capital applied to future lease payments.",

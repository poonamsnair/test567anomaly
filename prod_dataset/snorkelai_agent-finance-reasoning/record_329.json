  "user_question": "How has the company's stock-based compensation expense trend evolved over the three-year period from 2022 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's equity compensation strategy?",
  "final_answer": "The company's net stock-based compensation expense (after tax benefits) has shown consistent growth over the three-year period: $6,209 million in 2022, $7,960 million in 2023, and $8,908 million in 2024. This represents a 28.2% increase from 2022 to 2023 and an 11.9% increase from 2023 to 2024. The upward trend indicates the company is increasingly using equity compensation as a key component of its total compensation strategy, likely to attract and retain talent in a competitive market. However, the growth rate is decelerating, suggesting the company may be moderating its equity compensation increases.",

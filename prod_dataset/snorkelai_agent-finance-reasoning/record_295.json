  "user_question": "How significant is the company's valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024, and what does this suggest about management's assessment of future tax benefits?",
  "final_answer": "The company has established a valuation allowance ratio of 10.2% for its deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024. This relatively moderate valuation allowance suggests that management believes there is a reasonable likelihood that approximately 90% of the deferred tax assets will be realized in the future. The 10.2% allowance indicates some uncertainty about realizing all tax benefits, but overall reflects a cautiously optimistic view of the company's ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize these deferred tax assets.",

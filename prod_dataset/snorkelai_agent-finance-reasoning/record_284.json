  "user_question": "How is the company's lease obligation structured in terms of near-term versus long-term payment requirements?",
  "final_answer": "The company has a relatively balanced lease payment structure with a ratio of 1.091 between payments due within the next twelve months versus those due after. This indicates that near-term lease obligations are only slightly higher than long-term obligations, suggesting manageable cash flow requirements for lease payments without excessive front-loading of obligations.",

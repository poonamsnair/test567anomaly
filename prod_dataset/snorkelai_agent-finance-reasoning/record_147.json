  "user_question": "How effectively is the company managing its debt capacity and what does this suggest about its financial flexibility from 2023 to 2024?",
  "final_answer": "The company's debt management shows a concerning trend in financial flexibility. The ratio of unused borrowing capacity to total debt declined significantly from 1.08 in 2023 to 0.65 in 2024, representing a 40% decrease. This suggests the company has utilized more of its available credit facilities and has less financial cushion available. In 2023, the company had more unused borrowing capacity than its total debt outstanding, but by 2024, unused capacity was only 65% of total debt. This trend indicates reduced financial flexibility and could signal either increased capital needs, deteriorating credit conditions, or strategic debt utilization.",

As of December 31, 2024, the company's total debt stands at $7.907 billion. This is composed of $2.343 billion in current debt and $5.535 billion in long-term debt. The higher proportion of long-term debt suggests that the company is not under immediate pressure to repay a large portion of its obligations, which is a positive indicator of financial flexibility. When considering finance leases, the total debt and finance lease obligations are slightly higher, with a current portion of $2.456 billion and a long-term portion of $5.757 billion. This demonstrates a strategic approach to managing its debt, with a focus on long-term obligations, allowing for greater financial maneuverability in the short term.",

  "user_question": "What is the composition of the company's lease portfolio, and does it suggest a preference for operating leases over finance leases?",
  "final_answer": "The company shows a strong preference for operating leases over finance leases. Operating lease right-of-use assets represent 90.6% of total ROU assets as of September 28, 2024, while finance lease liabilities only account for 7.2% of total lease liabilities. This indicates the company predominantly uses operating leases, which provides greater flexibility and keeps lease obligations off the balance sheet under previous accounting standards.",

In 2024, the company reported operating lease right-of-use assets of $10,234 million and finance lease right-of-use assets of $1,069 million. The corresponding liabilities were $11,534 million for operating leases and $896 million for finance leases. This composition is consistent with the previous year, where in 2023, operating lease assets were $10,661 million and finance lease assets were $1,015 million, with liabilities of $11,818 million for operating leases and $1,024 million for finance leases. The significantly higher value of operating leases compared to finance leases in both assets and liabilities across both years strongly suggests a strategic preference for operating leases.",

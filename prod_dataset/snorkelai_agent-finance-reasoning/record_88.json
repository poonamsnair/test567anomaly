  "user_question": "How has the company's lease portfolio composition shifted between operating and finance leases from 2022 to 2024, and what does this indicate about their asset financing strategy?",
  "final_answer": "The company has been shifting away from finance leases toward operating leases over the three-year period. Operating lease costs as a percentage of total lease costs increased from 65.6% in 2022 to 60.5% in 2024, while finance lease costs (including both amortization and interest components) decreased from 4.5% in 2022 to 3.2% in 2024. This trend suggests the company is favoring more flexible lease arrangements that don't require asset ownership, which can improve balance sheet efficiency and provide greater operational flexibility. The shift toward operating leases may indicate a strategic preference for off-balance-sheet financing and reduced long-term asset commitments.",

      "content": "Based on the data from the Summary of Right-of-Use Assets and Lease Liabilities, the company's lease portfolio is heavily weighted towards operating leases. In 2023, operating leases constituted 94.27% of the total lease liabilities, and this proportion slightly increased to 94.87% in 2024. Conversely, finance leases saw a small decrease from 5.73% in 2023 to 5.13% in 2024. This indicates a consistent strategy of leasing assets for use without ownership, which can offer greater flexibility and lower initial cash outflows. The continued dominance of operating leases suggests a preference for an asset-light model, potentially to maintain agility in a dynamic business environment and to manage the balance sheet by keeping certain assets and liabilities off the primary financial statements. This approach can be indicative of a strategy that prioritizes operational flexibility over asset ownership.",

The unchanged indefinite-lived balance and rising finite-lived software/patents suggest an emphasis on internally developed or bolt-on technology capabilities that can be amortised over a few years, indicating a tactical, innovation-focused investment approach rather than large, long-dated brand acquisitions.",

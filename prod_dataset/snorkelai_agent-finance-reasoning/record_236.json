  "user_question": "What is the composition of the company's lease portfolio in terms of operating vs. finance leases as of September 28, 2024?",
  "final_answer": "The company's lease portfolio is heavily weighted toward operating leases. Operating lease right-of-use assets represent 90.6% of total ROU assets, while finance lease liabilities account for only 7.2% of total lease liabilities. This indicates the company primarily uses operating leases rather than finance leases, which suggests management prefers to keep lease obligations off the balance sheet where possible and maintain flexibility in their lease arrangements.",

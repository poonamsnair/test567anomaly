This trend suggests a successful tax planning strategy focused on minimizing the company's tax burden. The significant drop in the tax rate indicates that Walmart has likely been effective in utilizing tax deductions, credits, and other tax planning opportunities to reduce its taxable income. The consistent decrease in the effective tax rate points towards a proactive and well-executed tax strategy, possibly involving a combination of optimizing its business structure, taking advantage of changes in tax laws, and effectively managing its tax liabilities across different jurisdictions.",

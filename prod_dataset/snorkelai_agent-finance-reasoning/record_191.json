  "user_question": "How effectively is the company managing its cash returns from the DIRECTV investment relative to the accounting earnings recognized in 2024?",
  "final_answer": "The company is receiving cash distributions from DIRECTV at a rate of 1.458 times the earnings it recognizes from equity method investments in 2024. This ratio above 1.0 indicates that DIRECTV is distributing more cash than the company's proportionate share of DIRECTV's net income, which could suggest either strong cash generation by DIRECTV, distribution of accumulated earnings, or potentially return of capital. This is generally positive from a cash flow perspective as it provides more liquidity than the accounting earnings would suggest.",

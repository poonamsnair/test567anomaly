  "user_question": "What is the company's lease financing strategy and how does it compare between operating and finance leases in terms of cost structure and payment obligations?",
  "final_answer": "The company heavily favors operating leases over finance leases, with finance leases representing only 3.4% of total lease payments. This suggests a strategic preference for operating leases to keep debt off the balance sheet. The operating lease cost is significantly higher than short-term lease cost (6.7x ratio), indicating the company commits to longer-term lease arrangements. The imputed interest rate on finance leases is quite high at 42.9%, which may explain why the company prefers operating leases. Additionally, 40.4% of operating lease payments extend beyond 2029, showing significant long-term commitments that provide operational flexibility but also represent substantial future obligations.",

This is evident from the future minimum lease payments, where operating leases constitute a significantly larger portion of the company's lease portfolio. For instance, in 2025, operating lease payments are projected to be \\\\$3,032 million, while finance lease payments are only \\\\$33 million. This trend continues in the subsequent years, with operating lease payments consistently dwarfing finance lease payments. The total future minimum lease payments for operating leases amount to \\\\$21,149 million, compared to just \\\\$755 million for finance leases. After accounting for imputed interest, the present value of operating lease liabilities stands at \\\\$17,516 million, while that of finance leases is a mere \\\\$431 million. This indicates that FedEx's business model is structured around the flexibility and off-balance-sheet financing benefits often associated with operating leases. The significantly lower financial commitment to finance leases suggests a strategic decision to avoid the ownership-like risks and obligations that come with them.",

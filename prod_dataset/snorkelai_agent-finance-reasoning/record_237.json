  "user_question": "How has the company's international expansion progressed over the past three years, and what does this trend suggest about their global growth strategy?",
  "final_answer": "The company has shown consistent international expansion, with Non-U.S. income as a percentage of total income before taxes increasing from 10.35% in 2022 to 15.10% in 2023, and further to 17.03% in 2024. This represents a 65% increase over two years, indicating a deliberate and successful strategy to diversify revenue streams geographically and reduce dependence on domestic markets. The accelerating trend suggests the company is gaining traction in international markets and may be positioning itself for continued global growth.",

As a result, international sales’ share of total revenues ticked up from about 13.5 percent in 2022 to roughly 14.5 percent in 2023, then held near 14.3 percent in 2024. At the same time, non-U.S. long-lived assets dipped slightly in 2023 but rebounded to $3.56 billion in 2024, lifting the foreign asset ratio from 10.5 percent to 11.2 percent of the company’s total. This steady, double‐digit top-line growth abroad—and renewed investment in overseas assets—suggests GM is pursuing a deliberate, incremental expansion of its international footprint rather than a rapid, broad‐based global push, focusing on deepening its presence in selected foreign markets.",

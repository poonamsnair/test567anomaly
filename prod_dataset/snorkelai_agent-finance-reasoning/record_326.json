  "user_question": "How has the company's tax situation evolved in terms of current vs. deferred tax components over the past three years (fiscal 2023-2025)?",
  "final_answer": "The company's tax profile has shifted significantly over the three-year period. The ratio of current tax provision to total income tax expense has increased from 0.926 in fiscal 2023 to 1.031 in fiscal 2024 and further to 1.107 in fiscal 2025. This indicates a growing proportion of current tax obligations relative to deferred tax benefits, suggesting either improved profitability requiring immediate tax payments or changes in timing differences between book and tax accounting. The trend toward ratios above 1.0 in recent years indicates the company is paying more in current taxes than its total tax expense, likely due to deferred tax benefits.",

The absolute increase in current taxes reflects higher taxable earnings, while the swing to deferred benefits (-$171 m in 2024, ‑$663 m in 2025) suggests larger timing differences—e.g., accelerated depreciation, stock-based compensation, or other temporary items—reducing the overall tax charge in both 2024 and 2025.",

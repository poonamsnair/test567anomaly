  "user_question": "How significant is the company's international operations footprint in terms of asset allocation and income generation as of 2022-2024?",
  "final_answer": "The company has a moderate international presence with 13.8% of long-lived assets located in the Rest of the World as of December 31, 2024. However, foreign operations contributed only 13.2% of total income before income taxes in 2022, suggesting that while the company has established international asset base, the income generation from foreign operations is proportionally aligned with the asset allocation, indicating efficient but not dominant international operations.",

      "content": "Based on the analysis of Meta's financial data, the company's international operations footprint is significant in terms of both asset allocation and income generation, although there are some nuances in the data for the 2022-2024 period.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, Meta's long-lived assets are primarily concentrated in the United States, which holds approximately $135.5 billion (79.3%) of the total $170.9 billion. The rest of the world accounts for $35.4 billion, or about 20.7% of the total long-lived assets. This indicates a substantial, albeit minority, allocation of assets outside the US. Data for 2024 was not available in the provided information.\n\nFrom an income generation perspective, the international operations play a crucial role. In 2023, foreign sources contributed approximately $20.8 billion to the income before income tax, which is about 40.5% of the total income before tax of $51.4 billion. The domestic income for the same year was $30.6 billion. For the year 2022, foreign income was about $7.6 billion (29.3% of the total), and in 2021, it was $21.4 billion (37.2% of the total), showing a fluctuating but consistently significant contribution from international operations.\n\nIn summary, while the majority of Meta's long-lived assets are located in the United States, a substantial portion of its income is generated from international operations. In 2023, roughly one-fifth of the company's assets were outside the U.S., while international sources generated about two-fifths of the company's pre-tax income. This highlights the strategic importance of the global markets to Meta's overall financial performance.",

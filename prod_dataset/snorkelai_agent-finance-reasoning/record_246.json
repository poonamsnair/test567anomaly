  "user_question": "What does the company's lease portfolio composition tell us about its operational flexibility and financial obligations over the next five years?",
  "final_answer": "The company's lease portfolio shows strong near-term flexibility with 56.7% of total undiscounted lease liabilities due within the first five years, indicating manageable short to medium-term obligations. Additionally, the lease structure is predominantly operating leases, with finance leases representing only 7.2% of total lease liabilities. This composition suggests the company maintains significant operational flexibility, as operating leases typically offer more exit options and don't tie up as much capital as finance leases or outright purchases.",

The total lease obligations for the next five years (2025-2029) amount to $8.39 billion, with operating leases accounting for $7.955 billion (94.8%) and finance leases for $435 million (5.2%). The high proportion of operating leases allows the company to adapt to changing business needs without the long-term commitment of asset ownership. However, the substantial financial obligation of nearly $8.4 billion in lease payments over this period also represents a significant and relatively fixed cost, which could impact profitability and cash flow. The annual lease payments show a decreasing trend, from $1.991 billion in 2025 to $1.223 billion in 2029, which may provide increasing financial flexibility over time.",

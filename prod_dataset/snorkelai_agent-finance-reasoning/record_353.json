  "user_question": "How has the company's stock-based compensation expense evolved over the past three years (2022-2024), and what does this trend suggest about the company's equity compensation strategy?",
  "final_answer": "The company's net stock-based compensation expense has shown consistent growth over the three-year period, increasing from $6,209 million in 2022 to $7,960 million in 2023 (28.2% increase) and further to $8,908 million in 2024 (11.9% increase). This upward trend suggests the company is expanding its equity compensation programs, likely to attract and retain talent in a competitive market. The growth rate has moderated from 2023 to 2024, which could indicate the company is reaching a more sustainable level of equity compensation or adjusting its strategy in response to market conditions.",

The slowing rate of increase in FY 24 (versus FY 23) also suggests the company is calibrating its grants to balance incentive objectives against dilution and cost.",

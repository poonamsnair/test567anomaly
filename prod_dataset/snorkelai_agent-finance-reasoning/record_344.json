      "content": "In 2024, Meta's intangible asset portfolio, excluding goodwill, saw a significant increase of $127 million, growing from $363 million to $490 million. This growth was primarily driven by a substantial new investment in acquired software, which amounted to $192 million, a category that had no value in the previous year. Additionally, the company increased its holdings of acquired patents by $33 million, from $54 million to $87 million. In contrast, the value of acquired technology decreased by $101 million, from $296 million to $195 million, which can be attributed to amortization and a potential shift in investment focus. This change in the composition of Meta's intangible assets suggests a strategic pivot towards acquiring external software to bolster their technological capabilities, while continuing to invest in the protection of their intellectual property through patents.",

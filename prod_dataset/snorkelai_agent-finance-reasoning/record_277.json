  "user_question": "How has the company's investment portfolio performance improved in 2024, and what does this indicate about their risk management of available-for-sale debt securities?",
  "final_answer": "The company's investment portfolio performance has significantly improved in 2024. The ratio of gross gains to absolute gross losses from sales of AFS debt securities is 0.408, indicating that while the company is still realizing net losses on these sales, the losses have moderated compared to what would be expected in a stressed environment. Additionally, the accumulated unrealized loss decreased by 3.09% from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024, showing that the fair value of the securities portfolio has recovered. The unrealized loss ratio for securities held less than twelve months is only 0.003 (0.3%), suggesting that recent investments are performing well and the company is effectively managing duration and credit risk in their new positions.",

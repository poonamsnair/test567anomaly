This helps human learners to collectively build better internal\nrepresentations of their environment, including fairly high-level abstractions.\nThis paper is focused on \\ Point 1 \" and testing the \\ Guided Learning Hypothesis \", using\nmachine learning algorithms to provide experimental evidence. The experiments performed\nalso provide evidence in favor of the \\ Deeper Harder Hypothesis \" and associated \\ Abstractions\nHarder Hypothesis \". Machine Learning is still far beyond the current capabilities of humans,\nand it is important to tackle the remaining obstacles to approach AI. For this purpose, the\nquestion to be answered is why tasks that humans learn e\u000bortlessly from very few examples,\nwhile machine learning algorithms fail miserably?\n2. Recent work showed that rather deep feedforward networks can be very successfully trained when large\nquantities of labeled data are available (Ciresan et al., 2010; Glorot et al., 2011a; Krizhevsky et al., 2012).\nNonetheless, the experiments reported here suggest that it all depends on the task being considered, since\neven with very large quantities of labeled examples, the deep networks trained here were unsuccessful.\n4]",

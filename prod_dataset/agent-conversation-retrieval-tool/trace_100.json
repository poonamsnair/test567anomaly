  "final_answer": "The NORB dataset is unusual compared to other image datasets because it has only five instances per class. This results in poor training set variability which makes the nets learn quickly but generalize badly. It is also the only dataset that benefits substantially from a fixed pre-processing layer. Moreover, NORB's standard error rate deviation is bigger than CIFAR10's and identical nets with different initializations do not produce very consistent results.",

For MNIST and CIFAR10 such pre-processing has little or no e\u000bect. It is also\nworth noting that NORB's standard error rate deviation is bigger than CIFAR10's (see Tables 2\nand 3).

It contains 10 classes, each of them\nwith 5000 samples in the training set and 1000 in the test set. The images greatly vary inside each\nclass. They are not necessarily centered, may contain only parts of the object, and have varying\nbackgrounds. All of this makes CIFAR10 the hardest problem addressed in this paper. The CNN\nhas three maps, one for each color channel (RGB). The CIFAR10 images are relatively small in]",

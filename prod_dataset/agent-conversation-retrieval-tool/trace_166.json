Learning from other agents in an environment by the means\nof cultural transmission of knowledge with a peer-to-peer communication is an e\u000ecient and\nnatural way of acquiring or propagating common knowledge. The most popular belief on how\nthe information is transmitted between individuals is that bits of information are transmitted\nby small units, called memes, which share some characteristics of genes, such as self-replication,\nmutation and response to selective pressures (Dawkins, 1976).\n1arXiv:1301.4083v6  [cs.LG]  13 Jul 2013\nThis paper is based on the hypothesis (which is further elaborated in Bengio (2013a)) that\nhuman culture and the evolution of ideas have been crucial to counter an optimization issue:\nthis di\u000eculty would otherwise make it di\u000ecult for human brains to capture high level knowledge of the world without the help of other educated humans.

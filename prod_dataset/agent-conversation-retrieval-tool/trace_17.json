To systematically test the impact of various architectures on classi\fcation performance,\nwe present a fast CNN implementation on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Previous GPU\nimplementations of CNNs (Chellapilla et al. , 2006; Uetz and Behnke, 2009) were hard-coded to\nsatisfy GPU hardware constraints, whereas our implementation is \rexible and fully online (i.e.,\nTechnical Report No. IDSIA-01-11 2\nweight updates after each image). It allows for training large CNNs within days instead of months,\nsuch that we can investigate the in\ruence of various structural parameters by exploring large\nparameter spaces (Pinto et al. , 2009) and performing error analysis on repeated experiments.\nWe evaluate various networks on the handwritten digit benchmark MNIST (LeCun et al. , 1998)]",

      "content": "[and Shavlik, 1994).\nAs discussed in \\ Memes Divide and Conquer Hypothesis \\ societies can be viewed as a\ndistributed computational processing systems. In civilized societies knowledge is distributed\nacross di\u000berent individuals, this yields a space e\u000eciency. Moreover computation, i.e. each\nindividual can specialize on a particular task/topic, is also divided across the individuals in the\nsociety and hence this will yield a computational e\u000eciency. Considering the limitations of the\nhuman brain, the whole processing can not be done just by a single agent in an e\u000ecient manner.\nA recent study in paleoantropology states that there is a substantial decline in endocranial\nvolume of the brain in the last 30000 years Henneberg (1988). The volume of the brain shrunk\nto 1241 ml from 1502 ml (Henneberg and Steyn, 1993). One of the hypothesis on the reduction\nof the volume of skull claims that, decline in the volume of the brain might be related to the\nfunctional changes in brain that arose as a result of cultural development and emergence of\nsocieties given that this time period overlaps with the transition from hunter-gatherer lifestyle\nto agricultural societies.\n3.

Speci\fcally hard\nAI problems have been studied to create CAPTCHA's that are easy to solve for humans, but\nhard to solve for machines (Von Ahn et al., 2003). In this paper we are investigating a di\u000ecult\nproblem for the o\u000b-the-shelf black-box machine learning algorithms.1\n1.1 Curriculum Learning and Cultural Evolution Against E\u000bective Local Minima\nWhat Bengio (2013a) calls an e\u000bective local minimum is a point where iterative training\nstalls, either because of an actual local minimum or because the optimization algorithm is\n1. You can access the source code of some experiments presented in that paper and their hyperparameters from\nhere: https://github.com/caglar/kmatters\n2\nunable (in reasonable time) to \fnd a descent path (e.g., because of serious ill-conditioning). In\nthis paper, it is hypothesized that some more abstract learning tasks such as those obtained\nby composing simpler tasks are more likely to yield e\u000bective local minima for neural networks,\nand are generally hard for general-purpose machine learning algorithms.]",

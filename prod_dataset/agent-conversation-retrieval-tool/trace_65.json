The 1D grid has a block for each connection between two\nmaps. Thread blocks are 2D, with a corresponding thread for every kernel weight. The bias weight\nis included as an entire row of threads, thus requiring thread blocks to have ( Kx+1)\u0002Kythreads.\nMost of the time these additional Kythreads will do nothing, thread (0,0) being activated only\nfor blocks that have to process the bias.\n4 Experiments\nWe use a system with a Core i7-920 (2.66GHz), 12 GB DDR3 and four graphics cards: 2 x\nGTX 480 and 2 x GTX 580. The correctness of the CPU version is checked by comparing the\nanalytical gradient with its \fnite di\u000berence approximation. On GPU this is not possible because\nall computations are performed with single precision \roating point numbers. Hence the GPU\nimplementation's correctness is checked by comparing its results to those of a randomly initialized\nnet after training it for several epochs on the more accurate CPU version. Obtaining identical\nresults after trillions of operations is a strong indication of correctness.\nTechnical Report No. IDSIA-01-11 6]",

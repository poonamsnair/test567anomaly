      "content": "[using a curriculum. The experiments we have conducted provide positive evidence in favor of\nthis hypothesis. In our experiments, a two-tiered MLP architecture is trained on a dataset for\nwhich each image input contains three sprites, and the binary target class is 1 if all three have\nthe same shape. Black-box machine learning algorithms only got chance on this task. Standard\ndeep supervised neural networks also failed. However, using a particular structure and guiding\nthe learner by providing intermediate targets in the form of intermediate concepts (the presence of each object) allows to nail the task. Much better than chance but imperfect results are\nalso obtained by exploring architecture and optimization variants, pointing towards a di\u000ecult\noptimization task. We hypothesize that the learning di\u000eculty is due to the composition of two\nhighly non-linear tasks. Our \fndings are also consistent with hypotheses on cultural learning\ninspired by the observations of e\u000bective local minima (possibly due to ill-conditioning and the\ntraining procedure not being able to escape what appears like a local minimum).\nKeywords: Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Optimization, Evolution of Culture, Curriculum Learning, Training with Hints\n1.

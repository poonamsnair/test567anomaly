Our feature extractors are neither carefully designed nor pre-wired, but\nrather learned in a supervised way. Our deep hierarchical architectures achieve the best\npublished results on benchmarks for object classi\fcation (NORB, CIFAR10) and handwritten\ndigit recognition (MNIST), with error rates of 2.53%, 19.51%, 0.35%, respectively. Deep\nnets trained by simple back-propagation perform better than more shallow ones. Learning\nis surprisingly rapid. NORB is completely trained within \fve epochs. Test error rates on\nMNIST drop to 2.42%, 0.97% and 0.48% after 1, 3 and 17 epochs, respectively.\n1 Introduction\nThe human visual system e\u000eciently recognizes and localizes objects within cluttered scenes. For\narti\fcial systems, however, this is still di\u000ecult, due to viewpoint-dependent object variability,\nand the high in-class variability of many object types. Deep hierarchical neural models roughly\nmimick the nature of mammalian visual cortex, and by community consensus are among the most\npromising architectures for such tasks. The most successful hierarchical object recognition systems\nall extract localized features from input images, convolving image patches with \flters. Filter]",

For small nets the speedup is small (but still over 10)\nsince they \ft better inside the CPU cache, and GPU resources are underutilized. For huge nets\n(ex: Table 2) the GPU implementation is more than 60 times faster than a compiler-optimized\nCPU version. Given the \rexibility of our GPU version, this is a signi\fcant speedup. One epoch\ntakes 35 GPU minutes but more than 35 CPU hours.\n5 Conclusion\nWe presented high-performance GPU-based CNN variants trained by on-line gradient descent, with\nsparse random connectivity, computationally more e\u000ecient and biologically more plausible than\nfully connected CNNs. Principal advantages include state-of-the-art generalization capabilities,\ngreat \rexibility and speed. All structural CNN parameters such as input image size, number of\nhidden layers, number of maps per layer, kernel sizes, skipping factors and connection tables are\nadaptable to any particular application. We applied our networks to benchmark datasets for digit\nrecognition (MNIST), 3D object recognition (NORB), and natural images (CIFAR10). On MNIST\nthe best network achieved a recognition test error rate of 0.35%, on NORB 2.53% and on CIFAR10]",

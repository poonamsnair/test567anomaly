No such layer is used\nby Simard et al. (2003) who simply skips nearby pixels prior to convolution, instead of pooling\nor averaging. Scherer et al. (2010) found that max-pooling can lead to faster convergence, select\nsuperior invariant features, and improve generalization. The output of the max-pooling layer is\ngiven by the maximum activation over non-overlapping rectangular regions of size ( Kx,Ky). Maxpooling enables position invariance over larger local regions and downsamples the input image by\na factor ofKxandKyalong each direction.\nTechnical Report No. IDSIA-01-11 3\n2.4 Classi\fcation layer\nKernel sizes of convolutional \flters and max-pooling rectangles as well as skipping factors are\nchosen such that either the output maps of the last convolutional layer are downsampled to 1\npixel per map, or a fully connected layer combines the outputs of the topmost convolutional layer\ninto a 1D feature vector. The top layer is always fully connected, with one output unit per class\nlabel.]",

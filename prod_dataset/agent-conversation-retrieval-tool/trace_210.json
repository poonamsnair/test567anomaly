Culture and Optimization Di\u000eculty\nAs hypothesized in the \\ Local Descent Hypothesis \", human brains would rely on a local approximate descent, just like a Multi-Layer Perceptron trained by a gradient-based iterative optimization. The main argument in favor of this hypothesis relies on the biologically-grounded\nassumption that although \fring patterns in the brain change rapidly, synaptic strengths underlying these neural activities change only gradually, making sure that behaviors are generally\nconsistent across time. If a learning algorithm is based on a form of local (e.g. gradient-based)\ndescent, it can be sensitive to e\u000bective local minima (Bengio, 2013a).\nWhen one trains a neural network, at some point in the training phase the evaluation of\nerror seems to saturate, even if new examples are introduced. In particular Erhan et al. (2010)\n\fnd that early examples have a much larger weight in the \fnal solution. It looks like the learner\nis stuck in or near a local minimum. But since it is di\u000ecult to verify if this is near a true local]",

Nevertheless by providing hints about the intermediate\nconcepts (the presence and location of particular sprite classes), the problem can easily be solved\nwhere the same-architecture neural network without the intermediate concepts guidance fails.\nSurprisingly, our attempts at solving this problem with unsupervised pre-training algorithms\nfailed solve this problem. However, with speci\fc variations in the network architecture or\ntraining procedure, it is found that one can make a big dent in the problem. For showing the\nimpact of intermediate level guidance, we experimented with a two-tiered neural network, with\nsupervised pre-training of the \frst part to recognize the category of sprites independently of\ntheir orientation and scale, at di\u000berent locations, while the second part learns from the output\nof the \frst part and predicts the binary task of interest.\nThe objective of this paper is not to propose a novel learning algorithm or architecture,\nbut rather to re\fne our understanding of the learning di\u000eculties involved with composed tasks\n(here a logical formula composed with the detection of object classes), in particular the training\ndi\u000eculties involved for deep neural networks. The results also bring empirical evidence in favor\nof some of the hypotheses from Bengio (2013a), discussed below, as well as introducing a\nparticular form of curriculum learning (Bengio et al., 2009b).]",

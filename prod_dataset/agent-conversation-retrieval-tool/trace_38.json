Both convolutional layers use a kernel of 5 x 5 and skipping factors of 1.\n3 GPU implementation\nThe latest generation of NVIDIA GPUs, the 400 and 500 series (we use GTX 480 & GTX 580), has\nmany advantages over older GPUs, most notably the presence of a R/W L2 global cache for device\nmemory. This permits faster programs and simpli\fes writing the code. In fact, the corresponding\ntransfer of complexity into hardware alleviates many software and optimization problems. Our\nexperiments show that the CNN program becomes 2-3 times faster just by switching from GTX\n285 to GTX 480.\nTechnical Report No. IDSIA-01-11 4\nManual optimization of CUDA code is very time-consuming and error prone. We optimize for\nthe new architecture, relying on the L2 cache for many of the device memory accesses, instead of\nmanually writing code that uses textures and shared memory. Code obtained by this pragmatic\nstrategy is fast enough. We use the following types of optimization: pre-computed expressions,\nunrolled loops within template kernels, strided matrices to obtain coalesced memory accesses and]",

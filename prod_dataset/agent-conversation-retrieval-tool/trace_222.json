This is done by properly choosing the sequence of\nexamples seen by the learner, where simpler examples are introduced \frst and more complex\nexamples shown when the learner is ready for them. One of the hypothesis on why curriculum\nworks states that curriculum learning acts as a continuation method that allows one to discover\na good minimum, by \frst \fnding a good minimum of a smoother error function. Recent experiments on human subjects also indicates that humans teach by using a curriculum strategy\n(Khan et al., 2011).\nSome parts of the human brain are known to have a hierarchical organization (i.e. visual\ncortex) consistent with the deep architecture studied in machine learning papers. As we go from\nthe sensory level to higher levels of the visual cortex, we \fnd higher level areas corresponding\nto more abstract concepts. This is consistent with the Deep Abstractions Hypothesis .\nTraining neural networks and machine learning algorithms by decomposing the learning\ntask into sub-tasks and exploiting prior information about the task is well-established and\nin fact constitutes the main approach to solving industrial problems with machine learning.\nThe contribution of this paper is rather on rendering explicit the e\u000bective local minima issue\nand providing evidence on the type of problems for which this di\u000eculty arises.

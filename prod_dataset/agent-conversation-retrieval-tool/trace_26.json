Each layer has Mmaps of equal size ( Mx,My). A kernel (blue\nrectangle in Fig 1) of size ( Kx,Ky) is shifted over the valid region of the input image (i.e. the\nkernel has to be completely inside the image). The skipping factors SxandSyde\fne how many\npixels the \flter/kernel skips in x- and y-direction between subsequent convolutions. The size of\nthe output map is then de\fned as:\nMn\nx=Mn\u00001\nx\u0000Kn\nx\nSnx+ 1+ 1;Mn\ny=Mn\u00001\ny\u0000Kn\ny\nSny+ 1+ 1 (1)\nwhere index nindicates the layer.

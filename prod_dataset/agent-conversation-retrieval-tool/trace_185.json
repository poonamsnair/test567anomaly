      "content": "[by composing simpler tasks are more likely to yield e\u000bective local minima for neural networks,\nand are generally hard for general-purpose machine learning algorithms.\nThe idea that learning can be enhanced by guiding the learner through intermediate easier\ntasks is old, starting with animal training by shaping (Skinner, 1958; Peterson, 2004; Krueger\nand Dayan, 2009). Bengio et al. (2009b) introduce a computational hypothesis related to a\npresumed issue with e\u000bective local minima when directly learning the target task: the good\nsolutions correspond to hard-to-\fnd-by-chance e\u000bective local minima, and intermediate tasks\nprepare the learner's internal con\fguration (parameters) in a way similar to continuation methods in global optimization (which go through a sequence of intermediate optimization problems,\nstarting with a convex one where local minima are no issue, and gradually morphing into the\ntarget task of interest).\nIn a related vein, Bengio (2013a) makes the following inferences based on experimental\nobservations of deep learning and neural network learning:\nPoint 1: Training deep architectures is easier when some hints are given about the function\nthat the intermediate levels should compute (Hinton et al., 2006; Weston et al., 2008;\nSalakhutdinov and Hinton, 2009; Bengio, 2009).

But since it is di\u000ecult to verify if this is near a true local\nminimum or simply an e\u000bect of strong ill-conditioning, we call such a \\stuck\" con\fguration an\ne\u000bective local minimum , whose de\fnition depends not just on the optimization objective but\nalso on the limitations of the optimization algorithm.\nErhan et al. (2010) highlighted both the issue of e\u000bective local minima and a regularization e\u000bect when initializing a deep network with unsupervised pre-training. Interestingly, as\nthe network gets deeper the di\u000eculty due to e\u000bective local minima seems to be get more pronounced. That might be because of the number of e\u000bective local minima increases (more like\nan actual local minima issue), or maybe because the good ones are harder to reach (more like\nan ill-conditioning issue) and more work will be needed to clarify this question.\nAs a result of Point 4 we hypothesize that it is very di\u000ecult for an individual's brain to\ndiscover some higher level abstractions by chance only.

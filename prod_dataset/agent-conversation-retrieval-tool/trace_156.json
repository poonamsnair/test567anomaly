We motivate our work from the hypothesis\nthat there is an optimization obstacle involved in the nature of such tasks, and that humans\nlearn useful intermediate concepts from other individuals via a form of supervision or guidance\nusing a curriculum. The experiments we have conducted provide positive evidence in favor of\nthis hypothesis. In our experiments, a two-tiered MLP architecture is trained on a dataset for]",

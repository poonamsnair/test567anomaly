Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"action\": \"Final Answer\",\n    \"action_input\": string \\ You should put what you want to return to use here\n}\n```\n\nUSER'S INPUT\n--------------------\nHere is the user's input (remember to respond with a markdown code snippet of a json blob with a single action, and NOTHING else):\n\nHow does the Guided Learning Hypothesis explain the learning of high-level abstractions in a human brain?",

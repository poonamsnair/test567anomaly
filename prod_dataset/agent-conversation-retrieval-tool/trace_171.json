      "content": "[the following questions: are there machine learning tasks which are intrinsically hard for a\nlone learning agent but that may become very easy when intermediate concepts are provided\nby another agent as additional intermediate learning cues, in the spirit of Curriculum Learning (Bengio et al., 2009b)? What makes such learning tasks more di\u000ecult? Can speci\fc initial\nvalues of the neural network parameters yield success when random initialization yield complete failure? Is it possible to verify that the problem being faced is an optimization problem or\nwith a regularization problem? These are the questions discussed (if not completely addressed)\nhere, which relate to the following broader question: how can humans (and potentially one day,\nmachines) learn complex concepts?\nIn this paper, results of di\u000berent machine learning algorithms on an arti\fcial learning task\ninvolving binary 64 \u000264 images are presented. In that task, each image in the dataset contains\n3 Pentomino tetris sprites (simple shapes). The task is to \fgure out if all the sprites in the\nimage are the same or if there are di\u000berent sprite shapes in the image. Several state-of-the-art\nmachine learning algorithms have been tested and none of them could perform better than\na random predictor on the test set. Nevertheless by providing hints about the intermediate\nconcepts (the presence and location of particular sprite classes), the problem can easily be solved]",

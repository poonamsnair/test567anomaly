Experimental Setup\nSome tasks, which seem reasonably easy for humans to learn4, are nonetheless appearing almost\nimpossible to learn for current generic state-of-art machine learning algorithms.\nHere we study more closely such a task, which becomes learnable if one provides hints to\nthe learner about appropriate intermediate concepts. Interestingly, the task we used in our\nexperiments is not only hard for deep neural networks but also for non-parametric machine\nlearning algorithms such as SVM's, boosting and decision trees.\nThe result of the experiments for varying size of dataset with several o\u000b-the-shelf black box\nmachine learning algorithms and some popular deep learning algorithms are provided in Table\n1. The detailed explanations about the algorithms and the hyperparameters used for those\nalgorithms are given in the Appendix Section 5.2. We also provide some explanations about\nthe methodologies conducted for the experiments at Section 3.2.\n3.1 Pentomino Dataset\nIn order to test our hypothesis, an arti\fcial dataset for object recognition using 64 \u000264 binary\nimages is designed5. If the task is two tiered (i.e., with guidance provided), the task in the\n\frst part is to recognize and locate each Pentomino object class6in the image.

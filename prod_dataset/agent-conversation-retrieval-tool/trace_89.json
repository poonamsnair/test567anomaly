This allows us to quickly run numerous\nrepetitive experiments with huge networks with hundreds of maps per layer. We decided to use a\nCNN with \fve hidden layers: layer1, a convolutional layer with 300 maps, kernel size 6 \u00026 and\nskipping factors 1 \u00021; layer2, a max-pooling layer over a 2 \u00022 region; layer3, a convolutional layer\nwith 500 maps, kernel size 4 \u00024, skipping factors 0 \u00020; layer4, a max-pooling layer over a 4 \u00024\nregion; layer5, a fully connected layer with 500 neurons. The learning rate is initialized by 0.001\nand multiplied by 0.95 after every epoch.\nTable 2 summarizes the results of four di\u000berent experiments by switching on/o\u000b translation as\nwell as the \fxed image processing layer. We report the average error rate as well as the standard\ndeviation of N independent runs with identical architectures but di\u000berent weight initializations.\nFor the \frst experiment without translation and no image processing (IP), an average test error\nrate of 7.86% is obtained. With additional translations of at most 5%, the average error rate drops]",

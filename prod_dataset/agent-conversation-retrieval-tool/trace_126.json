Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"action\": \"Final Answer\",\n    \"action_input\": string \\ You should put what you want to return to use here\n}\n```\n\nUSER'S INPUT\n--------------------\nHere is the user's input (remember to respond with a markdown code snippet of a json blob with a single action, and NOTHING else):\n\nWhat is the advantage of using CNNs for image recognition?",
  "final_answer": "The advantage of using CNNs for image recognition is that they seem to be the best adaptive image recognizers, provided there is a labeled dataset of sufficient size. They do not require unsupervised pretraining and good results require big and deep but sparsely connected CNNs. They are also computationally feasible on current GPUs, where the implementation is 10 to 60 times faster than a compiler-optimized CPU version.",

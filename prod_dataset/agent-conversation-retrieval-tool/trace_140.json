Must be one of Vector Search Tool\n    \"action_input\": string \\ The input to the action\n}\n```\n\n**Option #2:**\nUse this if you want to respond directly to the human. Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"action\": \"Final Answer\",\n    \"action_input\": string \\ You should put what you want to return to use here\n}\n```\n\nUSER'S INPUT\n--------------------\nHere is the user's input (remember to respond with a markdown code snippet of a json blob with a single action, and NOTHING else):\n\nWhat is the strategy employed by B.

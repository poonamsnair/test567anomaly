This suggests that the number of di\u000berent e\u000bective local minima\n(even when considering them only in function space) must be huge.\nPoint 5: Unsupervised pre-training, which changes the initial conditions of the descent procedure, sometimes allows to reach substantially better e\u000bective local minima (in terms\nof generalization error!), and these better local minima do not appear to be reachable\nby chance alone (Erhan et al., 2010). The experiments performed here provide another\npiece of evidence in favor of the hypothesis that where random initialization can yield\nrather poor results, speci\fcally targeted initialization can have a drastic impact, i.e., that\n3\ne\u000bective local minima are not just numerous but that some small subset of them are much\nbetter and hard to reach by chance.2\nBased on the above points, Bengio (2013a) then proposed the following hypotheses regarding\nlearning of high-level abstractions.\n\u000fOptimization Hypothesis: When it learns, a biological agent performs an approximate\noptimization with respect to some implicit objective function.]",

A\u000ene (translation, rotation, scaling, horizontal shearing) and elastic deformations\n(Simard et al. , 2003) are combined. We use a variable learning rate that shrinks by a multiplicative\nconstant after each epoch, from 10\u00003down to 3 \u000110\u00005after 500 epochs.\nFully connected convolutional layers lead to an exploding number of network connections and\nweights, making training of big and deep CNNs for hundreds of epochs impractical even on GPUs.\nPartial connectivity alleviates this problem and is also biologically more plausible. We reduce\nthe number of connections between convolutional layers in a random way. Table 1 lists results\nof various networks with 2 to 7 hidden layers with random connections. Additional layers result\nin better networks, the best one achieving a test error of 0.35% for best validation and a best\ntest error of 0.27%. The best previous CNN result on MNIST is 0.40% (Simard et al. , 2003).]",

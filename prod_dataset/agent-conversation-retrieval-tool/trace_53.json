The output is obtained by passing the sum through a scaled tanh\nactivation function, and then written to device memory.\n3.3 Backward propagation\nBP of deltas can be done in two ways: by pushing or by pulling. Pushing deltas means taking each\ndelta from the current layer and computing the corresponding deltas for the previous layer. For\nan architecture with shared weights this has the disadvantage of being hard to code. Each delta\nfrom the current layer contributes to many deltas in the previous layer, which translates into a lot\nof programming. There are two ways of avoiding this: either writing partial deltas to a separated\nblock of memory and then putting everything together by calling another kernel (slow because\nof a tremendous increase in the number of memory accesses, and the need of another kernel), or\nusing atomic writes (to avoid data hazards) to update deltas (very slow because many writings\nare serialized). We implement pulling deltas, which has almost none of the above speed-limiting\ndrawbacks, but is a bit more complicated.\nTechnical Report No. IDSIA-01-11 5\nThe (uni- or bi-dimensional) thread grid assigns a (bi- or uni-dimensional) thread block to each]",

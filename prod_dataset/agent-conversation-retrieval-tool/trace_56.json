Similar to FP, for maps\nwith more than 1024 neurons, the 2D grid is further split into smaller 1D blocks by assigning a\n2D block to each row of the map. Each thread computes the delta of its corresponding neuron by\npulling deltas from the current layer. For every neuron in the previous layer we have to determine\nthe list of neurons in the current layer which are connected to it. Let us consider neuron ( i;j)\nfrom a map in layer Ln\u00001, and then assume that ( x;y) are the coordinates of neurons in maps\nofLnthat contribute to the delta of neuron ( i;j). The (x;y) neuron is connected to kernel size\nnumber neurons ( Kx\u0002Ky) from each connected map in the previous layer. The indices in Ln\u00001\nof the neurons connected through a kernel to the ( x;y) neuron are:\nx(Sx+ 1) \u0014i\u0014x(Sx+ 1) +Kx\u00001;\ny(Sy+ 1) \u0014j\u0014y(Sy+ 1) +Ky\u00001:]",

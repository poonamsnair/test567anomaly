  "final_answer": "The function of the first layer of P1NN is to apply the weight matrix and the vector of biases to the input patch/receptive field extracted from a single image. It is similar to a convolutional layer where the stride equals the kernel size, so that windows do not overlap. It can be decomposed into separate networks sharing the same parameters but applied on different patches of the input image.",

The second column stores the number of connections, followed by\ncorresponding indices of maps in Ln\u00001connected to the current map.\nFor BP and FP, analogous information about connections is needed. We therefore store backward connections in CBP. AW requires a list of all map connections (see Subsection 3.4), stored\nas an array of map index pairs. Dealing with biases in BP kernel requires to know where the\nweights of particular connections start; this information is stored in a 2D array WIDX BPof size\nMn\u0002Mn\u00001.\n3.2 Forward propagation\nA straightforward way of parallelizing FP is to assign a thread block to each map that has to\nbe computed. For maps bigger than 1024 neurons, the job is further split into smaller blocks by\nassigning a block to each line of the map, because the number of threads per block is limited (1024\nfor GTX 480). A one to one correspondence between threads and the map's neurons is assumed.\nBecause of weight sharing, threads inside a block can access data in parallel, in particular the\nsame weights and inputs from the previous layer. Each thread starts by initializing its sum with\nthe bias, then loops over all map connections, convolving the appropriate patch of the input map\nwith the corresponding kernel. The output is obtained by passing the sum through a scaled tanh]",

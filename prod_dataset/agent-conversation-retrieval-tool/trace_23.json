CNNs vary in how convolutional and subsampling layers are realized and how the nets\nare trained. The CNN architecture considered in this study di\u000bers from the one of Simard et al.\n(2003) in the sense that after each CNN-layer an optional max-pooling layer (Scherer et al. , 2010)\ncan be used. Here we give a complete description of this independent implementation (Fig. 1).\n2.1 Image processing layer\nThe image processing layer is an optional pre-processing layer of prede\fned \flters that are kept\n\fxed during training. Thus additional information besides the raw input image can be provided\nto the network, such as edges and gradients. In particular, we \fnd that a contrast-extracting layer\n(Fukushima, 2003) helps to improve the recognition rate for NORB.\n2.2 Convolutional layer]",

      "content": "To find the items from store 1 that have the highest units sold during a rainy day, I need to join three tables: `weather`, `sales_in_weather`, and `relation`. First, I should select the `item_nbr` from the `sales_in_weather` table. To join the tables, I can use INNER JOIN clauses to match the `date` column in `weather` with the `date` column in `sales_in_weather`, and match the `store_nbr` column in `sales_in_weather` with the `store_nbr` column in `relation`. Additionally, I need to include a condition to filter for store 1, which means the `store_nbr` should be equal to 1. To filter for a rainy day, I can use the `codesum` column in `weather` and check if it contains the string 'RA'. Finally, I can group the results by `item_nbr`, order them by `units` in descending order, and limit the output to 1 row. I should also pay attention to add backticks around table names and column names which contain space or special characters.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT T2.item_nbr FROM `weather` AS T1 INNER JOIN `sales_in_weather` AS T2 ON T1.date = T2.date INNER JOIN `relation` AS T3 ON T2.store_nbr = T3.store_nbr AND T1.station_nbr = T3.station_nbr WHERE T2.store_nbr = 1 AND T1.codesum LIKE '%' OR 'RA' OR '%' GROUP BY T2.item_nbr ORDER BY T2.units DESC LIMIT 1\n```",

According to the provided evidence, a bachelor's degree is classified as 'UG' in the column `type`. So, I can use a WHERE clause to specify the condition `type = 'UG'`. Additionally, I need to find the highest intelligence among all the students. I can achieve this by using a subquery with the MAX function to select the maximum value of the `intelligence` column from the `student` table. Finally, I can use a COUNT function to count the number of students who have the highest intelligence and a bachelor's degree.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(`student_id`) FROM `student` WHERE type = 'UG' AND `intelligence` = (SELECT MAX(`intelligence`) FROM `student`)\n```",

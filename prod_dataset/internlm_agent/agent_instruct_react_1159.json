  "anomaly_reason": "The trace indicates that the agent was supposed to use a SQL tool to run a command in MySQL, as described in the user's question and the available actions. However, there is no evidence in the trace of the agent actually using the SQL tool to execute the SQL command. The agent describes the SQL query it intends to use but does not show any tool usage or SQL execution in the trace. This discrepancy suggests a 'wrong_tool_call' or a failure to use the required tool, even though the agent claims the query was executed and returned the expected answer.",

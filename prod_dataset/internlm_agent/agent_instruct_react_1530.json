To match the corresponding rows in both tables, I can use the INNER JOIN clause with the condition `T1.Code = T2.Country`. Additionally, I need to filter the population range using the WHERE clause with the condition `T1.Population BETWEEN 60000000 AND 90000000`. To sort the results in descending order of GDP, I can use the ORDER BY clause with `T2.GDP DESC`. Finally, to retrieve only the nation with the greatest GDP, I can use the LIMIT clause with a limit size of 1.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT T1.Name, T2.GDP FROM `country` AS T1 INNER JOIN `economy` AS T2 ON T1.Code = T2.Country WHERE T1.Population BETWEEN 60000000 AND 90000000 ORDER BY T2.GDP DESC LIMIT 1\n```",

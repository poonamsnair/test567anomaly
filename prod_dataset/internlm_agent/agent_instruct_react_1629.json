You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself. Attention, your bash code should not contain any input operation, follow the format with ```bash\n#put your bash code here\n```\nIn the current directory, there is a hidden log file named \".log_file\". Your task is to count the number of distinct words in this file. A word is defined as having one or more non-space characters, separated by spaces. The computation should ignore case for all words.",

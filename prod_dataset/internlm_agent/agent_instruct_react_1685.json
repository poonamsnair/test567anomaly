You have access to the following actions: [{'name': 'bash', 'description': 'standard bash tool to run command in OS system'}, {'name': 'answer', 'description': 'if you have the answer, call this function'}]. Please generate the exact input for actions at each step. If the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself. Attention, your bash code should not contain any input operation, follow the format with ```bash\n#put your bash code here\n```\nCalculate the total size of all text (.txt) files within the current working directory, excluding subdirectories. The size should be output in bytes.",

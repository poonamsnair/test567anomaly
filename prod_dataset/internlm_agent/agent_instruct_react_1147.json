      "content": "To find out the number of events that the 88-years-old male users participated on 4th May, 2016, we need to join the `gender_age` table with the `events` table using the `device_id` column. We can use the INNER JOIN clause for this purpose. Then, we can filter the rows by specifying the conditions: `gender` should be 'M', `age` should be 88, and the `timestamp` should start with '2016-05-04'. To count the number of events, we can use the COUNT function on the `event_id` column. Finally, we can select the count value using the SELECT statement. I should also pay attention to add backticks around table names and column names which contain space or special characters.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(T2.event_id) FROM `gender_age` AS T1 INNER JOIN `events` AS T2 ON T2.device_id = T1.device_id WHERE T1.gender = 'M' AND SUBSTR(`timestamp`, 1, 10) = '2016-05-04' AND T1.age = 88\n```",

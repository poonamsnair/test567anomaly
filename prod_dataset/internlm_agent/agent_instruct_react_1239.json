The `CountryRegionCurrency` table connects the `Currency` table and the `CountryRegion` table through the `CurrencyCode` and `CountryRegionCode` columns. Therefore, we can use INNER JOIN clauses to join these three tables based on their respective keys. To filter the result to only include Brazil, we can add a WHERE clause with the condition `T3.Name = 'Brazil'`. Finally, we select the currency name from the `Currency` table, which is named `T1.Name`.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT T1.Name FROM `Currency` AS T1 INNER JOIN `CountryRegionCurrency` AS T2 ON T1.CurrencyCode = T2.CurrencyCode INNER JOIN `CountryRegion` AS T3 ON T2.CountryRegionCode = T3.CountryRegionCode WHERE T3.Name = 'Brazil'\n```",

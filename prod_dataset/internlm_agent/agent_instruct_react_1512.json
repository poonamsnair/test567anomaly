      "content": "To find the heaviest player drafted by the Arizona Coyotes, we need to select the weight of the players from the `PlayerInfo` table and join it with the `SeasonStatus` table and the `weight_info` table. We can use the `INNER JOIN` clause to match the player IDs in these tables. Then, we can filter the players who were drafted by the Arizona Coyotes by using the condition `T1.overallby = 'Arizona Coyotes'`. To find the heaviest player, we can order the results by the weight in pounds (`T3.weight_in_lbs`) in descending order and limit the result to 1 row. Finally, we can count the number of teams this player has played for by selecting the `TEAM` column from the `SeasonStatus` table and using the `COUNT` function.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(T2.TEAM) FROM `PlayerInfo` AS T1 INNER JOIN `SeasonStatus` AS T2 ON T1.ELITEID = T2.ELITEID INNER JOIN `weight_info` AS T3 ON T1.weight = T3.weight_id WHERE T1.overallby = 'Arizona Coyotes' ORDER BY T3.weight_in_lbs DESC LIMIT 1\n```",

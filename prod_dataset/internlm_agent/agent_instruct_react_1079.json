We can use the MAX function to find the maximum value between FTHG and FTAG. Additionally, we need to filter the results to only include matches from the 2021 season, so we can use a WHERE clause with the condition 'season = 2021'. To determine the team that made up that score, we can use a subquery to select the AwayTeam column. Finally, we can combine these conditions in the main query and select the maximum score and the corresponding AwayTeam.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT(SELECT MAX(MAX(`FTAG`), MAX(`FTHG`)) FROM `matchs` WHERE `season` = 2021) AS T1, `AwayTeam` FROM `matchs` WHERE `season` = 2021 AND `FTHG` = T1 OR `FTAG` = T1\n```",

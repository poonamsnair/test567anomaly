      "content": "To find the players who were born after 1950 and had offence rebound rates more than 30%, I can use the SELECT statement to retrieve the distinct last names and first names from the players table. I need to join the players table with the player_allstar table using the playerID column as the common column. Then, I can use the WHERE clause to filter the players based on the birthDate condition and the offence rebound rate condition. The birthDate condition can be expressed as T1.birthDate > '1950-01-01' since the birthDate column is in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'. The offence rebound rate condition can be calculated by dividing the o_rebounds column by the rebounds column and checking if the result is greater than 0.3. Finally, I can use the DISTINCT keyword to remove any duplicate rows from the result.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT T1.lastName, T1.firstName FROM `players` AS T1 INNER JOIN `player_allstar` AS T2 ON T1.playerID = T2.playerID WHERE T1.birthDate > 1950 AND CAST(T2.o_rebounds AS REAL) * 100 / T2.rebounds > 30\n```",

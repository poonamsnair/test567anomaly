Please generate the exact input for actions at each step. If the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself. Attention, your bash code should not contain any input operation, follow the format with ```bash\n#put your bash code here\n```\nIn the `/usr/bin` directory of your Linux system, search for executable files that contain the name \"python\". Count the total number of lines (including comment lines) in all these files. To ensure system integrity, you cannot modify or move these files.",

Please generate the exact input for actions at each step. If the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself. Attention, your bash code should not contain any input operation, follow the format with ```bash\n#put your bash code here\n```\nSome common types of \"files\" in a Linux system are regular files, directories, symbolic links, sockets, and named pipes. Your task is to count how many files of each type exist in your current directory and its subdirectories.",

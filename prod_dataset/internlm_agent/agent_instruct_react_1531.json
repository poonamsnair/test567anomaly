The user's instructions required the SQL to be executed and the output to be handled by the agent, but the 'tools_used' list is empty, and there are no steps showing the actual execution of the SQL command. This discrepancy suggests a sequence error, as the agent claims to have executed and obtained results from an SQL query without showing the use of the SQL tool.",

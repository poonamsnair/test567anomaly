      "content": "To calculate the percentage of complaints made by Google account clients in server ZOHARI, I need to find the count of Complaint IDs where the email ends with '@gmail.com' and divide it by the total count of Complaint IDs. To achieve this, I can use the COUNT function with a condition in the WHERE clause to count the number of Complaint IDs where the email matches the pattern. Then, I can use the COUNT function without any condition to count the total number of Complaint IDs. After that, I can calculate the percentage by dividing the count of Google account Complaint IDs by the total count and multiplying it by 100. To filter the complaints made in server ZOHARI, I can use the INNER JOIN clause to join the 'client' and 'callcenterlogs' tables on the 'client_id' and 'rand client' columns respectively, and add a condition in the WHERE clause to check if the server is 'ZOHARI'. I should also pay attention to add backticks around table names and column names which contain space or special characters.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T1.email LIKE '%@gmail.com' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T1.email) FROM `client` AS T1 INNER JOIN `callcenterlogs` AS T2 ON T1.client_id = T2.rand `client` WHERE T2.server = 'ZOHARI'\n```",

Despite the user's clear instruction to use the SQL tool for database operations and to format SQL statements in markdown within the interaction, there is no record of SQL tool usage or SQL code formatted as instructed. This discrepancy indicates a sequence error, as the agent claims to have executed an SQL query and received an output without showing the use of the SQL tool or the formatted SQL statement.",

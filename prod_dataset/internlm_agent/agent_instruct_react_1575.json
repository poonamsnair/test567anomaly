Please generate the exact input for actions at each step. If the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself. Attention, your bash code should not contain any input operation, follow the format with ```bash\n#put your bash code here\n```\nCount the total sum of numbers that lie within the last 100 lines of the text file \"numbers.txt\", where each line of the file has a single whole number. Report the sum as your answer.",

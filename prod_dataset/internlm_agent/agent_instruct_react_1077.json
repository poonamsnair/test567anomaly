Your SQL should be in one line.\nEvery time you can only execute one SQL statement. I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nI expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate.

Furthermore, the user's input directly provides the answer without showing the execution of the SQL command by the agent, which contradicts the agent's claim of executing an SQL query to obtain the answer.",

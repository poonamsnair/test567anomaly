      "content": "To find the age of the oldest active user that participated in the event held on 5/6/2016 at coordinates 121, 31, I need to join three tables: `app_events`, `events_relevant`, and `gender_age`. First, I should match the `event_id` column in `app_events` with the `event_id` column in `events_relevant`, and then match the `device_id` column in `events_relevant` with the `device_id` column in `gender_age`. To filter the active users, I can use a WHERE clause with `is_active = 1`. To filter the events held on 5/6/2016 at coordinates 121, 31, I can use conditions `SUBSTR(T2.timestamp, 1, 10) = '2016-05-06'` for the date and `T2.longitude = 121 AND T2.latitude = 31` for the coordinates. Finally, I can order the result by `T3.age` in descending order and limit the result to 1 row using the LIMIT clause.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT T3.age FROM `app_events` AS T1 INNER JOIN `events_relevant` AS T2 ON T1.event_id = T2.event_id INNER JOIN `gender_age` AS T3 ON T2.device_id = T3.device_id WHERE T1.is_active = 1 AND T2.longitude = 121 AND T2.latitude = 31 AND SUBSTR(T2.timestamp, 1, 10) = '2016-05-06' ORDER BY T3.age DESC LIMIT 1\n```",

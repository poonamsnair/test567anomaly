First, we can use INNER JOIN to match the attribute_id between Attributes and Business_Attributes tables, and then match the business_id between Business_Attributes and Reviews tables. We also need to add a condition to filter the attribute_name to be 'Delivery'. Next, we can use GROUP BY clause and COUNT function to calculate the number of reviews each user has done. Finally, by using ORDER BY clause with DESC order and a LIMIT clause with limit size 1, we can select the user with the most reviews.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT T3.user_id FROM `Attributes` AS T1 INNER JOIN `Business_Attributes` AS T2 ON T1.attribute_id = T2.attribute_id INNER JOIN `Reviews` AS T3 ON T2.business_id = T3.business_id WHERE T1.attribute_name = 'Delivery' GROUP BY T3.user_id ORDER BY COUNT(T2.business_id) DESC LIMIT 1\n```",

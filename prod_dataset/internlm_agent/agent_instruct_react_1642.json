Please generate the exact input for actions at each step. If the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself. Attention, your bash code should not contain any input operation, follow the format with ```bash\n#put your bash code here\n```\nYou need to figure out which is the largest file located directly in your home directory. In this context the \"largest\" means the file has the maximum byte size, and only the regular files are considered.",

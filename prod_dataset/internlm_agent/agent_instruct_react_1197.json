      "content": "To calculate the percentage of female competitors whose heights are over 170 that participated in the game in 1988, we need to count the number of female competitors whose heights are over 170 and divide it by the total number of competitors. We can achieve this by using the COUNT function with a CASE statement inside to filter the desired conditions. Then, we can use the INNER JOIN clause to join the tables `games`, `games_competitor`, and `person` based on their respective IDs. After that, we can apply the WHERE clause to filter the games that occurred in 1988. Finally, we can calculate the percentage by multiplying the count of female competitors whose heights are over 170 by 100 and dividing it by the total count of competitors.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN T3.gender = 'F' AND T3.height > 170 THEN 1 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T2.person_id) FROM `games` AS T1 INNER JOIN `games_competitor` AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.games_id INNER JOIN `person` AS T3 ON T2.person_id = T3.id WHERE T1.games_year = 1988\n```",

Since the street name 'Atlantic Ave' is mentioned, I can use an INNER JOIN clause to match the restaurants in the `generalinfo` table with their corresponding locations in the `location` table. The join condition will be `T1.id_restaurant = T2.id_restaurant` to ensure the correct matching. Additionally, I need to filter the results to only include restaurants located on Atlantic Ave, which can be done by adding a WHERE clause with the condition `T2.street_name = 'atlantic ave'`.

I can use the INNER JOIN clause for this purpose. Additionally, I need to filter the rows where either the first word or the second word is equal to 'nombre'. I can achieve this by using the OR operator in the WHERE clause and subqueries to get the word ID for the word 'nombre'. Finally, I can calculate the sum of the 'occurrences' column in the 'biwords' table to get the total occurrence of the paired words.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT SUM(T2.occurrences) FROM `words` AS T1 INNER JOIN `biwords` AS T2 ON T1.wid = T2.w1st OR T1.wid = T2.w2nd WHERE T2.w1st IN((SELECT `wid` FROM `words` WHERE `word` = 'nombre') OR T2.w2nd IN(SELECT `wid` FROM `words` WHERE `word` = 'nombre'))\n```",

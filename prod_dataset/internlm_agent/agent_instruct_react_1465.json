The question asks for the IDs, names, and producing countries of the cars with the maximum number of cylinders. To achieve this, I need to join the `data` table with the `production` table on the `ID` column. Then, I can further join the `country` table on the `origin` column to get the producing countries. By ordering the result by `cylinders` in descending order and using a LIMIT clause with a limit of 1, I can obtain the row with the maximum number of cylinders.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT T1.ID, T1.car_name, T3.country FROM `data` AS T1 INNER JOIN `production` AS T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID INNER JOIN `country` AS T3 ON T3.origin = T2.country WHERE T2.model_year = 1975 ORDER BY T1.cylinders DESC LIMIT 1\n```",

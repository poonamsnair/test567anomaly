      "content": "To find the best selling products during the year 2003, we need to consider the table `orders` and the column `orderDate`. The year 2003 can be obtained by extracting the year from the `orderDate` column using the STRFTIME function. We can use INNER JOIN to connect the `orders` table with the `orderdetails` table on the `orderNumber` column. Then, we can further join the `orderdetails` table with the `products` table on the `productCode` column. To calculate the total quantity sold for each product, we can use the SUM function on the `quantityOrdered` column. Finally, we can group the results by the `productName`, order them in descending order based on the sum of `quantityOrdered`, and limit the output to the top 3 products.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT t3.productName, SUM(t2.quantityOrdered) FROM `orders` AS t1 INNER JOIN `orderdetails` AS t2 ON t1.orderNumber = t2.orderNumber INNER JOIN `products` AS t3 ON t2.productCode = t3.productCode WHERE STRFTIME('%Y', t1.orderDate) = '2003' GROUP BY t3.productName ORDER BY SUM(t2.quantityOrdered) DESC LIMIT 3\n```",

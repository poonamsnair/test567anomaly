Your SQL should be in one line.\nEvery time you can only execute one SQL statement. I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block.

We can achieve this by using the COUNT function with a condition in the WHERE clause. Then, we multiply this count by 100 to get the percentage value. To calculate the total number of app IDs, we can use the COUNT function without any condition.

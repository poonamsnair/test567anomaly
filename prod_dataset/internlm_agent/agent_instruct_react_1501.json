      "content": "To find the reference ID of under 10 who got a response from the marketing department, I need to select the education status of these customers. I can achieve this by using an INNER JOIN clause to match the customers' ID from the `Customers` table with the reference ID from the `Mailings1_2` table. Then, I can add the conditions `T2.REFID < 10` and `T2.RESPONSE = 'true'` in the WHERE clause to filter out the customers with reference ID under 10 who got a response. Finally, I select the `EDUCATIONNUM` column from the `Customers` table to get their education status.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT T1.EDUCATIONNUM FROM `Customers` AS T1 INNER JOIN `Mailings1_2` AS T2 ON T1.ID = T2.REFID WHERE T2.REFID < 10 AND T2.RESPONSE = 'true'\n```",

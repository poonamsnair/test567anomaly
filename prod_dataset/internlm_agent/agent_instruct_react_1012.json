Since we are only interested in French movies, we can use the WHERE clause to filter the rows where the country_name is 'France'. To get the average revenue, we can use the AVG function. To achieve this, we can join the movie table with the production_country table on the movie_id column and then join the result with the country table on the country_id column. Finally, we can apply the WHERE clause to filter the rows with country_name = 'France' and use the AVG function on the revenue column.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(T1.revenue) FROM `movie` AS T1 INNER JOIN `production_country` AS T2 ON T1.movie_id = T2.movie_id INNER JOIN `country` AS T3 ON T2.country_id = T3.country_id WHERE T3.country_name = 'France'\n```",

However, we need to make sure that the `height` value is not null, so we add a condition `height IS NOT NULL`. We can then order the result in ascending order using `ORDER BY height ASC` and limit the result to only one row using `LIMIT 1`. To get the team ID of that player from 1925 to 1936, we can use an INNER JOIN between the `Master` and `Scoring` tables. We select the `playerID` and `tmID` columns from the `Scoring` table, where the `year` is between 1925 and 1936. Finally, we join this result with the shortest player's `playerID` from the `Master` table.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT T2.playerID, T2.tmID FROM(SELECT `playerID` FROM `Master` WHERE `height` IS NOT NULL ORDER BY `height` ASC LIMIT 1) AS T1 INNER JOIN(SELECT DISTINCT `playerID`, `tmID` FROM `Scoring` WHERE year BETWEEN 1925 AND 1936) AS T2 ON T1.playerID = T2.playerID\n```",

Please generate the exact input for actions at each step. If the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself. Attention, your bash code should not contain any input operation, follow the format with ```bash\n#put your bash code here\n```\nUsing your linux system, find all txt files and count total number of lines in these files. Note that the files can be in nested directories as well.",

      "content": "To find the medium through which most complaints are registered in Florida, we need to consider the table `callcenterlogs` and its column `Submitted via`. We also need to join this table with the `client` table on the column `rand client` and `client_id`, and with the `events` table on the column `Complaint ID`. To filter the complaints in Florida, we can use the condition `T2.state = 'FL'`. Then, by grouping the results by `Complaint ID` and ordering them by the count of `Complaint ID` in descending order, we can identify the medium with the most complaints. Finally, we can limit the result to 1 row using the `LIMIT` clause. I should also pay attention to add backticks around table names and column names which contain space or special characters.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT T3.Submitted via FROM `callcenterlogs` AS T1 INNER JOIN `client` AS T2 ON T1.rand `client` = T2.client_id INNER JOIN `events` AS T3 ON T1.Complaint `ID` = T3.Complaint `ID` WHERE T2.state = 'FL' GROUP BY T1.Complaint `ID` ORDER BY COUNT(T1.Complaint `ID`) DESC LIMIT 1\n```",

We can use a WHERE clause with the condition `subject_weapon = 'Handgun'`. Then, we group the rows by the year of the date column using the STRFTIME function with the format '%Y'. This allows us to count the number of cases for each year. To find the year with the greatest number of cases, we can order the groups by the count of case_number in descending order using the ORDER BY clause. Finally, we can limit the result to only the first row using the LIMIT clause.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT STRFTIME('%Y', date) FROM `incidents` WHERE `subject_weapon` = 'Handgun' GROUP BY STRFTIME('%Y', date) ORDER BY COUNT(`case_number`) DESC LIMIT 1\n```",

The agent then interprets this response correctly as indicating no incidents where a Handgun was used as a weapon, and provides a final answer accordingly.

We can achieve this by using the COUNT function with a condition inside the IIF function to count only the store contacts, and then dividing it by the count of all employees. We can join the Person and Employee tables using INNER JOIN to access the required columns for the conditions. The conditions for the store contact, western name style, and married employee can be expressed using WHERE clause with appropriate conditions.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT CAST(COUNT(IIF(T1.PersonType = 'SC', T1.PersonType, NULL)) AS REAL) / COUNT(T1.PersonType) FROM `Person` AS T1 INNER JOIN `Employee` AS T2 WHERE T1.PersonType = 'SC' AND T1.NameStyle = 0 AND T2.MaritalStatus = 'M'\n```",

To filter the countries with more than 70% of Chinese, I can use an INNER JOIN clause to match the country codes between the `country` table and the `ethnicGroup` table. Then, I can use a WHERE clause to specify that the `Name` in the `ethnicGroup` table should be 'Chinese' and the `Percentage` should be greater than 70. Finally, I can multiply the `Population` column with the `Percentage` column to calculate the population of Chinese in each country.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT T1.Name, T1.Population * T2.Percentage FROM `country` AS T1 INNER JOIN `ethnicGroup` AS T2 ON T1.Code = T2.Country WHERE T2.Name = 'Chinese' AND T2.Percentage > 70\n```",

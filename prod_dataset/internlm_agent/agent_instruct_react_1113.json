First, we need to select the `name` column from the `no_payment_due` table and join it with the `person` table on the `name` column. Then, we can use a WHERE clause to filter out the names that are not in the `male` table. Finally, we add another condition in the WHERE clause to select only the rows where the `bool` column in the `no_payment_due` table is equal to 'neg'.

I can achieve this by using an INNER JOIN clause to match the team IDs (tmID) and years (year) between the 'teams' table (T1) and the 'players_teams' table (T2).

Finally, by selecting the distinct team IDs (tmID), I can identify the teams that had the most same starting players throughout the season.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT T1.tmID FROM `teams` AS T1 INNER JOIN `players_teams` AS T2 ON T1.tmID = T2.tmID AND T1.year = T2.year WHERE T2.GP = T2.GS\n```",

      "content": "To calculate the percentage of Professor Ogdon Zywicki's research assistants who are taught postgraduate students, I need to join three tables: RA, prof, and student. First, I should select the count of student_id from table RA, and then calculate the count of student_id where the type is 'TPG' (taught postgraduate student) and the first name is 'Ogdon' and the last name is 'Zywicki' from table student. I can use a CASE statement to count the number of 'TPG' students and then sum them up. Next, I can join the RA table with the prof table on the prof_id column and join the RA table with the student table on the student_id column. Finally, I can filter the rows where the first name is 'Ogdon' and the last name is 'Zywicki' from the prof table. By dividing the sum of 'TPG' students by the total count of students, I can calculate the percentage. The result should be multiplied by 100 to get the percentage value.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T3.type = 'TPG' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T1.student_id) FROM `RA` AS T1 INNER JOIN `prof` AS T2 ON T1.prof_id = T2.prof_id INNER JOIN `student` AS T3 ON T1.student_id = T3.student_id WHERE T2.first_name = 'Ogdon' AND T2.last_name = 'Zywicki'\n```",

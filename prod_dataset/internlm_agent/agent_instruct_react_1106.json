In the given table `Business`, the column `active` indicates whether a business is running or not. We can use a CASE statement to check if `active` is equal to 'true' and assign a value of 1 if it is, otherwise assign a value of 0. By summing up these values and dividing it by the total count of `business_id`, we can get the percentage of running businesses. To ensure the result is in decimal format, we can cast the sum as REAL before performing the division.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN `active` = 'true' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(`business_id`) FROM `Business`\n```",

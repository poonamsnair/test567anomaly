The agent's final answer implies that an SQL query was executed ('The SQL query executed successfully...'), yet there are no steps showing the use of the SQL tool or the execution of any SQL statement. This discrepancy suggests a sequence error, as the agent claims to have used a tool (SQL) before it's available or without showing its use in the trace.",

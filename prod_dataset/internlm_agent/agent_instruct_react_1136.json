Since the game name '3D Lemmings' is mentioned, I can use a WHERE clause to filter the rows where the `game_name` column equals '3D Lemmings'. To connect the `game` table with the `publisher` table, I can use INNER JOIN clause with `game_publisher` table as the intermediate table. By matching the `id` column of `game` table with the `game_id` column of `game_publisher` table, and the `publisher_id` column of `game_publisher` table with the `id` column of `publisher` table, I can retrieve the publisher name.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT T3.publisher_name FROM `game` AS T1 INNER JOIN `game_publisher` AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.game_id INNER JOIN `publisher` AS T3 ON T2.publisher_id = T3.id WHERE T1.game_name = '3D Lemmings'\n```",

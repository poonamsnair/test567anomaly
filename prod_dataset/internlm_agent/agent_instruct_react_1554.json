Please generate the exact input for actions at each step. If the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself. Attention, your bash code should not contain any input operation, follow the format with ```bash\n#put your bash code here\n```\nYou have a directory called \"files_directory\" scattered with numerous text files. You are required to tell, how many of those files contain the word \"Linux\".",

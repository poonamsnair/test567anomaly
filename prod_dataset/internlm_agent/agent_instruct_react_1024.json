We can achieve this by joining the `station` table with the `trip` table using the `start_station_name` column. Then, we group the results by `bike_id` and order them in descending order based on the count of `id` (which represents the number of trips made by each bike). Finally, we limit the result to only one row using the `LIMIT` clause. Additionally, we can select the `start_station_name`, `end_station_name`, `city`, and calculate the total duration in hours by dividing the `duration` by 3600.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT T2.bike_id, T2.start_station_name, T2.end_station_name, T1.city, CAST(T2.duration AS REAL) / 3600 FROM `station` AS T1 INNER JOIN `trip` AS T2 ON T1.name = T2.start_station_name GROUP BY T2.bike_id ORDER BY COUNT(T2.id) DESC LIMIT 1\n```",

You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself. Attention, your bash code should not contain any input operation, follow the format with ```bash\n#put your bash code here\n```\nYour Task is to count the number of PDF files in the home directory and its subdirectories. List and save the absolute path of these files onto a text file called \"PDFList.txt\".",

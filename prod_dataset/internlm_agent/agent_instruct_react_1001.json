First, I can use INNER JOIN to match the `cust_id` column in the `customer` table with the `cust_id` column in the `shipment` table. Then, I can use another INNER JOIN to match the `driver_id` column in the `driver` table with the `driver_id` column in the `shipment` table. To filter the shipments done by Sue Newell for S K L Enterprises Inc, I can add conditions in the WHERE clause: `T1.cust_name = 'S K L Enterprises Inc'` for the customer name and `T3.first_name = 'Sue' AND T3.last_name = 'Newell'` for the driver name. Finally, I can use the COUNT(*) function to count the number of rows returned by the query.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM `customer` AS T1 INNER JOIN `shipment` AS T2 ON T1.cust_id = T2.cust_id INNER JOIN `driver` AS T3 ON T3.driver_id = T2.driver_id WHERE T1.cust_name = 'S K L Enterprises Inc' AND T3.first_name = 'Sue' AND T3.last_name = 'Newell'\n```",

Attention, your bash code should not contain any input operation, follow the format with ```bash\n#put your bash code here\n```\nYou are developing a program that displays files through an interactive terminal UI. As a part of this program, you want to build a feature to list all regular files in a specified directory (ignoring everything else). For now you want to count the number of all regular files only in your home directory, both visible and hidden, without entering any subdirectories.",

Please generate the exact input for actions at each step. If the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself. Attention, your bash code should not contain any input operation, follow the format with ```bash\n#put your bash code here\n```\nYou have three different directories under your home directory: \"texts\", \"archives\", and \"processed\". The \"texts\" directory contains text files, and \"archives\" contains tar archives of text files. Your task is to:\n\n1. Extract all tar archives inside the \"archives\" folder into their respective directories into the \"processed\" directory.\n2. Count the total number of non-unique words from all text files under the \"texts\" and \"processed\" directory.\n\nPlease note, non-unique words count each occurrence of a word separately.",

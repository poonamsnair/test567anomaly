There are no explicit errors in tool usage, no contradictions in reasoning, and the agent does not give up without attempting to solve the task. The mention of 'Explicit Retry detected' in errors does not directly indicate a failure to retry or an inappropriate action; it could be part of normal operation attempting to fulfill the task.",

      "content": "To find the short description of the crime committed the most by criminals in the least populated community, I need to join three tables: `Community_Area`, `Crime`, and `FBI_Code`. First, I should match the `community_area_no` column in the `Community_Area` table with the `community_area_no` column in the `Crime` table using an INNER JOIN clause. Then, I should match the `fbi_code_no` column in the `Crime` table with the `fbi_code_no` column in the `FBI_Code` table using another INNER JOIN clause. By grouping the result by the `title` column in the `FBI_Code` table, I can count the occurrences of each crime. To find the least populated community, I should order the result by the `population` column in the `Community_Area` table in ascending order. Finally, to get the crime committed the most, I should also order the result by the `fbi_code_no` column in the `FBI_Code` table in descending order. By limiting the result to 1 row, I can obtain the short description of the crime committed the most in the least populated community.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT T3.title FROM `Community_Area` AS T1 INNER JOIN `Crime` AS T2 ON T1.community_area_no = T2.community_area_no INNER JOIN `FBI_Code` AS T3 ON T2.fbi_code_no = T3.fbi_code_no GROUP BY T3.title ORDER BY T1.population ASC, T3.fbi_code_no DESC LIMIT 1\n```",

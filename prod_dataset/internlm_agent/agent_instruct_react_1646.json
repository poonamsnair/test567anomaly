You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself. Attention, your bash code should not contain any input operation, follow the format with ```bash\n#put your bash code here\n```\nTrack down all the files in your home folder that were last modified more than 7 days ago and are greater than 1M in size. Your answer should display the counts of such files.",

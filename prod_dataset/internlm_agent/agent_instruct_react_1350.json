According to the given evidence, the higher the IBU, the more bitter the beer is. Therefore, we can use the SELECT statement to retrieve the brewery's name and the city from the tables 'beers' and 'breweries' respectively. We can use the INNER JOIN clause to match the brewery_id in the 'beers' table with the id in the 'breweries' table. To narrow down the search to New York, we can add a WHERE clause with the condition 'state = 'NY''. Finally, we can use the ORDER BY clause with the 'ibu' column in descending order and the LIMIT clause to retrieve only the top result.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT T2.name, T2.city FROM `beers` AS T1 INNER JOIN `breweries` AS T2 ON T1.brewery_id = T2.id WHERE T2.state = 'NY' ORDER BY T1.ibu DESC LIMIT 1\n```",

Your SQL should be in one line.\nEvery time you can only execute one SQL statement. I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nI expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself.\nCreate a new record in the table 'Employees' with the following information: name = 'Emily Johnson', age = 30, department = 'HR', salary = 5000, and joining_date = '2022-05-01'.\nThe name of the table is 'Employees' and it has five columns named 'name', 'age', 'department', 'salary', and 'joining_date'.",

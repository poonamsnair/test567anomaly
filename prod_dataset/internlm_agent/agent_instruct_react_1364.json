The make 'Mack' corresponds to the column `make` in the table `truck`. The oldest refers to the minimum value of the column `model_year` in the same table. We can use the MIN function to find the oldest model year. Then, we can join the `truck` table with the `shipment` table using the common column `truck_id`. Finally, we can calculate the average shipment weight by selecting the AVG function on the `weight` column from the joined tables.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(T2.weight) FROM `truck` AS T1 INNER JOIN `shipment` AS T2 ON T1.truck_id = T2.truck_id WHERE T1.make = 'Mack'\n```",

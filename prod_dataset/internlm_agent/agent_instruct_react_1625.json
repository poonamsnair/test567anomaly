Please generate the exact input for actions at each step. If the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself. Attention, your bash code should not contain any input operation, follow the format with ```bash\n#put your bash code here\n```\nRun a simulation on the system to measure load by creating a specific number of empty files in a test directory named 'load_simulation' in your home directory. Then, identify the regular files (not directories or special files) in that directory. Provide your answer as string with number total files found.",

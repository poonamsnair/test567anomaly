Please generate the exact input for actions at each step. If the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself. Attention, your bash code should not contain any input operation, follow the format with ```bash\n#put your bash code here\n```\nUse the /proc/meminfo file located in the proc filesystem to retrieve the total memory capacity in kilobytes (KB) of your computer.

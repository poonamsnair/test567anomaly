      "content": "To calculate the average download for entertainment apps with size no more than 1.0 M, we need to filter the rows where the category is 'ENTERTAINMENT' and the size is less than '1.0M'. We can use the WHERE clause with the conditions Category = 'ENTERTAINMENT' and Size < '1.0M'. Then, to calculate the average download, we can use the AVG function on the Installs column. However, the Installs column contains values with commas and plus signs, so we need to remove them before performing the average calculation. We can use the REPLACE function to remove the commas and plus signs, and then cast the result as an integer using the CAST function.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE(`Installs`, ',', ''), '+', '') AS INTEGER)) FROM `playstore` WHERE `Category` = 'ENTERTAINMENT' AND Size < '1.0M'\n```",

You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself. Attention, your bash code should not contain any input operation, follow the format with ```bash\n#put your bash code here\n```\nFind the list of files in your home directory that have been modified within the last 24 hours and contain a specific word, \"FIXED\". Output the number of such files.",

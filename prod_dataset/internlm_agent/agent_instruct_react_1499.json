The condition 'from 1962 to 2011' can be expressed as the `year` column being between 1962 and 2011. The condition 'received both NBA and ABA awards' can be expressed as the `award` column being 'NBA Coach of the Year' and 'ABA Coach of the Year'. To count the number of distinct coaches who satisfy these conditions, we can use the COUNT and DISTINCT functions. The SQL query to retrieve this information is: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT coachID) FROM awards_coaches WHERE year BETWEEN 1962 AND 2011 AND award = 'ABA Coach of the Year' AND coachID IN (SELECT coachID FROM awards_coaches WHERE year BETWEEN 1962 AND 2011 AND award = 'NBA Coach of the Year').\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `coachID`) FROM `awards_coaches` WHERE year BETWEEN 1962 AND 2011 AND `award` = 'ABA Coach of the Year' AND `coachID` IN(SELECT `coachID` FROM `awards_coaches` WHERE year BETWEEN 1962 AND 2011 AND `award` = 'NBA Coach of the Year')\n```",

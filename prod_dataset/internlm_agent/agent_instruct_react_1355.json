      "content": "To calculate the average, highest, and lowest annual payments collected between 1/1/2003 to 12/31/2005, we need to consider the `payments` table. The `paymentDate` column should be between '2003-01-01' and '2005-12-31', so we can use a WHERE clause to filter the rows based on this condition. The average annual payments can be calculated by dividing the sum of the `amount` column by 3. To find the highest and lowest annual payments, we can use the MAX and MIN functions on the `amount` column. Additionally, we need to join the `payments` table with the `customers` table using the `customerNumber` column to retrieve the necessary information. Now, let's construct the SQL query.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT CAST(SUM(T1.amount) AS REAL) / 3, MAX(T1.amount), MIN(T1.amount) FROM `payments` AS T1 INNER JOIN `customers` AS T2 ON T1.customerNumber = T2.customerNumber WHERE T1.paymentDate BETWEEN '2003-01-01' AND '2005-12-31'\n```",

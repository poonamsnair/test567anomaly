First, I should select the count of ActorID where the Birth Country is 'USA' and sum it. Then, I divide this sum by the count of all ActorID to get the ratio. Finally, I multiply this ratio by 100 to get the percentage. To filter the movie 'Mrs. Doubtfire', I can use a WHERE clause with the condition Title = 'Mrs. Doubtfire'. I should also pay attention to add backticks around table names and column names which contain space or special characters.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T3.Birth `Country` = 'USA' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T3.Birth `Country`) FROM `movie` AS T1 INNER JOIN `characters` AS T2 ON T1.MovieID = T2.MovieID INNER JOIN `actor` AS T3 ON T3.ActorID = T2.ActorID WHERE T1.Title = 'Mrs. Doubtfire'\n```",

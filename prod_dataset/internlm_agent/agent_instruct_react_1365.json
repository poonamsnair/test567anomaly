Then, I can use a SELECT statement with a CASE statement to sum up the goals scored by Ian Schultz (`PlayerName = 'Ian Schultz'`) and divide it by the total goals scored (`SUM(T1.G)`). To get the percentage, I multiply the result by 100. Additionally, I need to add conditions in the WHERE clause to filter the data for the 2007-2008 season (`T1.SEASON = '2007-2008'`) and the Calgary Hitmen team (`T1.TEAM = 'Calgary Hitmen'`).\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T2.PlayerName = 'Ian Schultz' THEN T1.G ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / SUM(T1.G) FROM `SeasonStatus` AS T1 INNER JOIN `PlayerInfo` AS T2 ON T1.ELITEID = T2.ELITEID WHERE T1.SEASON = '2007-2008' AND T1.TEAM = 'Calgary Hitmen'\n```",

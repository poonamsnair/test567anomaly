Your SQL should be in one line.\nEvery time you can only execute one SQL statement. I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nI expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate.

The record contains Name, Email, Age and Phone Number for a new customer. Choose random values for each field.\nThe name of this table is Customer and it has four headers: Name, Email, Age, and Phone Number.",

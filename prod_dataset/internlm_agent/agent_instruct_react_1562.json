You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself. Attention, your bash code should not contain any input operation, follow the format with ```bash\n#put your bash code here\n```\nPerform a search and count the number of audio (.mp3, .wav, .flac, etc.) and video files (.mp4, .avi, .mkv, .flv, etc.) in your home directory in combination.",

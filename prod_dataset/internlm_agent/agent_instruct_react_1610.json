You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself. Attention, your bash code should not contain any input operation, follow the format with ```bash\n#put your bash code here\n```\nYou have to find out how large is the space that plain text files `.txt` occupying in \"example_directory\" and its subdirectories. Assuming 1 byte per character, please calculate the total number of characters (thus size) in such `.txt` files.",

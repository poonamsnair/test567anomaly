      "content": "To find the top 5 most popular movie directors, we need to select the director's name from the `person` table. To link the director's name with the movies they directed, we can use INNER JOIN clause to join the `movie_crew` table with the `person` table on the `person_id` column. Then, we can further join the `movie` table with the `movie_crew` table on the `movie_id` column. To filter only the directors, we can add a WHERE clause with the condition `job = 'Director'`. Finally, we can order the result by the popularity of the movies in descending order using the ORDER BY clause and limit the output to the top 5 directors using the LIMIT clause.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT T3.person_name FROM `movie` AS T1 INNER JOIN `movie_crew` AS T2 ON T1.movie_id = T2.movie_id INNER JOIN `person` AS T3 ON T2.person_id = T3.person_id WHERE T2.job = 'Director' ORDER BY T1.popularity DESC LIMIT 5\n```",

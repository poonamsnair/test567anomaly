I can do this by using INNER JOIN clause and matching the client_id from the client table with the Client_ID from the events table. Additionally, I need to specify the conditions for Mr Gunner Omer Fuller, which include matching the first name, middle name, last name, and sex. Therefore, I can use a WHERE clause with the specified conditions. Finally, I can select the Sub-issue column from the events table to get the detailed issue.

The agent uses the search tool to find a high-speed micro USB cable under $40, clicks on a product that meets the criteria, and then clicks 'Buy Now' to attempt a purchase. There are no explicit errors in tool usage, no contradictions in reasoning, and the agent does not give up without retrying. The mention of an 'Explicit Retry detected' error does not directly correlate with any of the defined anomaly categories without further context indicating a failure or inappropriate action.",

First, we can use an INNER JOIN clause to combine the two tables based on the `id` and `university_id` columns. Then, we can use a WHERE clause to filter the rows where the `university_name` is 'Harvard University' and the `year` is 2012. Finally, we can calculate the number of international students by multiplying the `num_students` and `pct_international_students` columns and dividing the result by 100.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT CAST(T2.num_students * T2.pct_international_students AS REAL) / 100 FROM `university` AS T1 INNER JOIN `university_year` AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.university_id WHERE T1.university_name = 'Harvard University' AND T2.year = 2012\n```",

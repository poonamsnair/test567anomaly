The join condition is that the character in the `voice-actors` table should match the hero in the `characters` table, and the movie in the `voice-actors` table should match the movie_title in the `characters` table. We can use an INNER JOIN clause to perform this join. Then, we select the `voice-actor` column from the `voice-actors` table. This will give us the voice actors for all the heroes. I should also pay attention to add backticks around table names and column names which contain space or special characters.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT T2.voice - actor FROM `characters` AS T1 INNER JOIN `voice-actors` AS T2 ON T2.character = T1.hero WHERE T2.movie = T1.movie_title\n```",

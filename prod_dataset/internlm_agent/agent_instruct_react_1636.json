Please generate the exact input for actions at each step. If the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself. Attention, your bash code should not contain any input operation, follow the format with ```bash\n#put your bash code here\n```\nCount and return the numebr of audio files in your home directory and all its subdirectories when given mp3, wav, and flac as selected audio file extensions.",

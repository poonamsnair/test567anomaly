Despite this error, the agent did not attempt to correct the mistake or retry the operation with the correct column name, leading to a sequence of actions that does not logically follow the error encountered. This represents a sequence error, as the agent claims to have corrected the issue without showing an explicit step of correction or acknowledging the error directly.",

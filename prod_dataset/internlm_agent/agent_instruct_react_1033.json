      "content": "To find the game with the most number of competitors in the Winter and Summer Olympics of 1988, I need to select the season and count the number of competitors for each season. I can achieve this by joining the `games` table with the `games_competitor` table using the `games_id` column. Then, I can use the WHERE clause to filter the games with names '1988 Winter' and '1988 Summer'. By grouping the result by the season and using the COUNT function on the `person_id` column, I can calculate the number of competitors for each season. To find the difference between the number of competitors in the two games, I can subtract the count of competitors in the Winter game from the count of competitors in the Summer game. Finally, I can order the result in descending order and limit the result to 1 row to get the game with the most competitors.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT P1, (SELECT MAX(P2) - MIN(P2) FROM(SELECT COUNT(T2.person_id) AS P2 FROM `games` AS T1 INNER JOIN `games_competitor` AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.games_id WHERE T1.games_name IN('1988 Winter', '1988 Summer') GROUP BY T1.season) ORDER BY P2 DESC LIMIT 1) FROM(SELECT T1.season AS P1, COUNT(T2.person_id) AS P2 FROM `games` AS T1 INNER JOIN `games_competitor` AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.games_id WHERE T1.games_name IN('1988 Winter', '1988 Summer') GROUP BY T1.season) ORDER BY P2 DESC LIMIT 1\n```",

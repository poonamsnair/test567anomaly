The requirement for a restaurant to meet all requirements is that the score should be equal to 100. Therefore, we can use a WHERE clause to filter the rows where the score is equal to 100. To count the number of rows that meet this condition, we can use the COUNT function on the `score` column. So, the SQL query would be: SELECT COUNT(score) FROM inspections WHERE score = 100.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(`score`) FROM `inspections` WHERE `score` = 100\n```",

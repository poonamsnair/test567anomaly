Your SQL should be in one line.\nEvery time you can only execute one SQL statement. I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nI expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself.\nAn ice cream shop needs to add a new flavor into their database. The new flavor is called 'Mint Chocolate Chip' and has a price of $4.99 for a scoop in a cup.\nThe name of the table is Flavors, and the headers of this table are Name and Price.",

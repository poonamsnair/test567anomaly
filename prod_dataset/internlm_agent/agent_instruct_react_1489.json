This can be done by subtracting the birthdate from the date of the encounter. To retrieve this information, I will use an INNER JOIN clause to match the patient ID in the patients table with the PATIENT column in the encounters table. Then, I will use a WHERE clause to filter the results based on the first name 'Laronda' and last name 'Bernier'. By ordering the results in descending order of the encounter date and limiting the output to 1 row, I can obtain the most recent medical encounter for Mrs. Laronda Bernier and calculate her age at that time.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT T2.DATE - T1.birthdate AS age FROM `patients` AS T1 INNER JOIN `encounters` AS T2 ON T1.patient = T2.PATIENT WHERE T1.first = 'Laronda' AND T1.last = 'Bernier' ORDER BY T2.DATE DESC LIMIT 1\n```",

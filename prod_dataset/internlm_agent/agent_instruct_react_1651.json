Please generate the exact input for actions at each step. If the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself. Attention, your bash code should not contain any input operation, follow the format with ```bash\n#put your bash code here\n```\nYour friend gave you a mystery to solve. He has created several text files (.txt) throughout your machine. He wants to know - how many unique words are there in total in all the text files under the \"/home\" directory of your Linux. However, instead of the exact word count, he has thrown in a challenge. You are to respond in MB, rounded down.",

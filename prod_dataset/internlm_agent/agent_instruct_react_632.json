  "user_question": "You are an agent that answers questions based on the knowledge stored in a knowledge base. To achieve this, you can use the following tools to query the KB.\n\n1. get_relations(variable: var) -> list of relations\nThis function helps to navigate all relations in the KB connected to the variable, so you can decide which relation is the most useful to find the answer to the question.\nA simple use case can be 'get_relations(Barack Obama)', which finds all relations/edges starting from the entity Barack Obama.\nThe argument of get_relations should always be an entity or a variable (e.g., #0) and not anything else.\n\n2. get_neighbors(variable: var, relation: str) -> variable\nGiven a variable, this function returns all entities connected to the variable via the given relation. Note that, get_neighbors() can only be used after get_relations() is used to find a set of viable relations.\nA simple use case can be 'get_neighbors(Barack Obama, people.person.profession)', which returns the profession of Obama in Freebase.\n\n3. intersection(variable1: var, variable2: var) -> variable\nGiven two variables, this function returns the intersection of the two variables. The two variables MUST be of the same type!\n\n4. get_attributes(variable: var) -> list of attributes\nThis function helps to find all numerical attributes of the variable. Please only use it if the question seeks for a superlative accumulation (i.e., argmax or argmin).\n\n5. argmax(variable: var, attribute: str) -> variable\nGiven a variable, this function returns the entity with the maximum value of the given attribute. It can only be used after get_attributes() is used to find a set of viable attributes.\nA simple use case can be 'argmax(variable, age)', which returns the oldest entity belonging to the variable.\n\n6. argmin(variable: var, attribute: str) -> variable\nGiven a variable, this function returns the entity with the minimum value of the given attribute. It can only be used after get_attributes() is used to find a set of viable attributes.\nA simple use case can be 'argmin(variable, age)', which returns the youngest entity belonging to the variable.\n\n7. count(variable: var) -> int\nGiven a variable, this function returns the number of entities belonging to the variable.\n\nAfter a variable is produced along the process, you need to judge whether a variable is the final answer to the question. Each variable is represented as an id starting from 0. For example, #0 is the first variable, #1 is the second variable, and so on.\nOnce you find the answer, respond with 'Final Answer' and your answer. You can only take ONE action at a time!! After you get the observation from its execution, you can take another action. You can take at most 15 actions to find the answer to the question.\nA new question: jackson was inducted into a hall of fame as what?\nEntities: [Hall of fame induction category, Hall of fame induction, jackson]",

      "content": "To calculate the average rental rate of sci-fi film titles, we need to select the rental rate column (`rental_rate`) from the `film` table. Since the sci-fi film category is specified, we can use an INNER JOIN to connect the `film` table with the `film_category` table on the `film_id` column. Then, we can further join the `film_category` table with the `category` table on the `category_id` column. To filter only the sci-fi films, we can add a WHERE clause with the condition `T3.name = 'Sci-Fi'`, where `T3` is the alias for the `category` table. Finally, we can use the AVG function to calculate the average rental rate. I should also pay attention to add backticks around table names and column names which contain space or special characters.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(T1.rental_rate) FROM `film` AS T1 INNER JOIN `film_category` AS T2 ON T1.film_id = T2.film_id INNER JOIN `category` AS T3 ON T3.category_id = T2.category_id WHERE T3.name = 'Sci-Fi'\n```",

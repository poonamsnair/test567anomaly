      "content": "To find the employee who has been in the Engineering Department the longest, I need to join three tables: `Person`, `EmployeeDepartmentHistory`, and `Department`. First, I should select the `FirstName` and `LastName` columns from the `Person` table. Then, I can use INNER JOIN to match the `BusinessEntityID` column in `Person` with the `BusinessEntityID` column in `EmployeeDepartmentHistory`. Next, I can use another INNER JOIN to match the `DepartmentID` column in `EmployeeDepartmentHistory` with the `DepartmentID` column in `Department`. To filter for employees in the Engineering Department, I can add a WHERE clause with the condition `T3.Name = 'Engineering'`. Finally, I can order the results by the length of stay in the department, which is calculated as `T2.EndDate - T2.StartDate`, in descending order using the ORDER BY clause. To get only the employee with the longest stay, I can use the LIMIT clause with a limit of 1.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT T1.FirstName, T1.LastName FROM `Person` AS T1 INNER JOIN `EmployeeDepartmentHistory` AS T2 ON T1.BusinessEntityID = T2.BusinessEntityID INNER JOIN `Department` AS T3 ON T2.DepartmentID = T3.DepartmentID WHERE T3.Name = 'Engineering' ORDER BY T2.EndDate - T2.StartDate DESC LIMIT 1\n```",

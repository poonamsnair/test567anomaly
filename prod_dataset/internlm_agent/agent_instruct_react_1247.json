      "content": "To calculate the profit the company will gain if they sell 10 items of the product with the lightest weight, we need to find the product with the lightest weight. The lightest product can be determined by finding the minimum value of the 'Weight' column. We can use the MIN() function to achieve this. Then, to calculate the profit, we subtract the 'StandardCost' from the 'ListPrice' and multiply it by 10, as the company is selling 10 items. Finally, we can select this calculated profit from the 'Product' table, making sure to exclude any rows where the 'Weight' column is NULL. We can order the results by the 'Weight' column in ascending order and limit the result to 1 row to get the product with the lightest weight.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT 10 * (`ListPrice` - `StandardCost`) FROM `Product` WHERE `Weight` IS NOT NULL ORDER BY `Weight` LIMIT 1\n```",

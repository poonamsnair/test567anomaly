  "true_answer": "Here's a classic chocolate chip cookie recipe: Combine 1 cup of softened butter, 1 cup of white sugar, and 1 cup of packed brown sugar until smooth. Mix in 2 eggs, one at a time, followed by 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. Dissolve 1 teaspoon of baking soda in 2 teaspoons of hot water, then blend into the batter along with 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Stir in 3 cups of flour and 2 cups of chocolate chips. Drop by large spoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for about 10 minutes until edges are nicely browned. The image of the baked cookies has been generated.",

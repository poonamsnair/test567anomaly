# AI Agent Trajectory Anomaly Detection System

## Problem Context and Introduction

We are addressing a critical challenge in the emerging field of autonomous AI agents - the need to detect and diagnose anomalies in agent execution patterns to ensure reliable, efficient, and safe autonomous operations **without relying on human-labeled training data**.

Modern autonomous agents are complex systems that can:
- Decompose tasks and create execution plans
- Call various tools and external APIs
- Access memory and context systems
- Engage in multi-step reasoning
- Make observations about their environment
- Hand off work to other specialized agents
- Handle errors and adapt strategies

However, as these systems become more sophisticated and autonomous, they can exhibit various failure modes including:
- Infinite reasoning loops
- Suboptimal tool choices
- Memory system failures
- Cascading errors across tool calls
- Context loss during multi-agent handoffs

## Critical Real-World Constraint: No Human Labels Available

In production autonomous agent systems, human operators typically **cannot and do not** label execution traces as anomalous or normal because:

- **Lack of Domain Expertise**: Humans lack the technical knowledge to understand optimal agent behavior
- **Volume**: Thousands of traces generated daily make manual review impossible
- **Subtlety**: Many anomalies involve complex multi-agent coordination patterns
- **Cost**: Expert human annotation would be prohibitively expensive
- **Evolving Definitions**: What constitutes an anomaly changes as agent capabilities evolve

Therefore, our anomaly detection system operates in a **completely unsupervised manner** using only raw execution traces without any ground truth labels.

## Synthetic Data Purpose and Validation Strategy

The synthetic data serves two critical purposes:

1. **Validation Environment**: Create controlled scenarios with known normal/anomalous patterns to tune and evaluate models before deploying on unlabeled real-world data
2. **Pattern Learning**: Bootstrap understanding of normal agent execution patterns to build models that can identify deviations

The ultimate goal is deployment on real agent execution traces where no labels exist, using techniques like:
- Statistical outlier detection
- Density-based anomaly identification
- Reconstruction error analysis
- Ensemble methods for pattern discovery

## Agent Trajectory Representation

Each agent trajectory represents a complete execution trace from initial user query to final response, capturing:

- **Decision-making process**: How agents break down complex tasks
- **Tool interactions**: Web searches, API calls, document processing
- **Reasoning steps**: Analysis, inference, planning
- **Memory operations**: Context storage and retrieval
- **Inter-agent communications**: Handoffs and coordination
- **Error handling patterns**: Recovery and adaptation strategies

These trajectories are computational graphs showing how autonomous agents:
- Decompose complex tasks
- Allocate work across specialized sub-agents
- Manage shared context and memory
- Recover from failures
- Coordinate to produce final outputs

## Anomaly Types Implemented

The system implements 10 specific anomaly types with configurable severity levels:

1. **Infinite Loops** (Critical): Circular dependencies causing endless execution
2. **Suboptimal Paths** (Medium): Unnecessarily complex routes to simple solutions
3. **Tool Failure Cascades** (High): Multiple consecutive tool failures
4. **Planning Paralysis** (Medium): Excessive planning without execution
5. **Memory Inconsistencies** (High): Contradictory memory operations
6. **Timeout Cascades** (High): Chains of operations exceeding time limits
7. **Handoff Failures** (Critical): Failed context transfer between agents
8. **Validation Loops** (Medium): Excessive validation without resolution
9. **Context Drift** (Low): Gradual deviation from original query intent
10. **Incomplete Responses** (Critical): Trajectories ending without final output
